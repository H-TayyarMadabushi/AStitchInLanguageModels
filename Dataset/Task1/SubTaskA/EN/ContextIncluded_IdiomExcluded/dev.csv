1,"Does the plumbing predictably rebel, creating a 1,000-foot cascade inside the central utility shaft? Are these interruptions of the good life a necessary condition of the high life? Not at all , says James von Klemperer, president of the architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, which plants skyscrapers all over the world: “In a building that thin, this kind of thing can happen, but it shouldn’t."
1,"Let’s be honest – we would be chuffed if our bosses gave us a box of chocolates or a gift voucher as a Christmas treat. But for Australian fashion designer Abby Kheir, there's no reason not to treat her employees to a taste of the high life all-year round. Speaking to the Daily Mail , the owner of Abyss by Abby explained how she doesn't mind splashing out on her staff members so they all feel valued."

1,"There were signs everywhere of cosy, comfortable indoor-wear leaving its mark on outdoor styles, with both Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons layering up looks over long-johns. Fendi offered swaddling, belted coats resembling dressing gowns over warm trousers, all in materials promising soft relaxation as much as the adventurous high life. Shawl collars and enveloping dressing-gown styles were also on show at Zegna, while even windbreaker brand K-Way blurred lines between indoor and outdoor wear."
1,"Yet one thing is clear. Rick Ross and Diddy exemplify the high life, two bosses who are, by all counts, richer than they've ever been. Check out the picture below, and be sure to show some love to some hip-hop moguls in their natural habitat. And who knows -- maybe we'll see Puff on his ad-lib game when Rick Ross drops his new album, vocals you already know were laced with blade firmly in hand."

Or request that Coloradans who live in zip codes where the average life expectancy is lower than average be given earlier vaccine access than those in high life expectancy zip codes. Such actions, Persad believes, could help improve rollout policies without sacrificing speed."

As Murphy puts it: “Slowly I began to realize that when white people are alone, they give things to each other."
1,"Drug traffickers today realize that their best protection is not a private army but anonymity. This is the story of “Memo Fantasma” or “Will the Ghost,” who started life in the Medellín Cartel, funded the bloody rise of a paramilitary army, and today lives the high life in Madrid.

1,"The report, entitled The Future of the Global Muslim Population, was part of a Pew Forum program analysing religious change and its impact on societies around the world. Alan Cooperman, Pew Forum associate director for research, said the results refuted claims made by some critics of Muslim immigration that high birth rates would make Muslims the majority in Europe within a few decades. Muslim minorities will grow to around 10 percent of the population in several European countries, he said, adding: Those are substantial increases but they are very far from 'Eurabia' scenario of runaway growth."
1,"For women between the ages of 30 and 34, the birth rate increased by 1 percent over 2015 — the highest rate for this age group since 1964. The birth rate for women who are between 35 and 39 is up 2 percent over 2015, representing the highest rate since 1962. Even older women, those between the ages of 40 and 44, showed a swelling increase of 4 percent over 2015 — the highest rate for this group since 1966, according to the statisticians, while the rate of birth for women who are older than 45 is also a record high though the number of births remains essentially unchanged compared to last year."
1,"Adrian Zenz, an expert on China's policies in Xinjiang told the BBC that the recent accounts provide ""authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed."" Previous reports have also shown that Uighur women were forcibly sterilized and given unwanted abortions as part of China's campaign to keep Muslim minorities' birth rate down. Uighurs in Xinjiang, including some in detention camps, have also been moved across China to forcibly work in factories, a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found."
1,"This is also supported by a number of other findings: For example, several older studies show that women whose cycles are in sync with that of the moon have the highest probability of becoming pregnant. Two large longitudinal studies demonstrate a significant correlation between birth rate and lunar phase with a slight increase in birth rate at full moon and a corresponding decrease at new moon. Recent evidence also suggests that births are more likely to occur at night during a full moon and during the day when there is a new moon."
1,"Birth rates are falling in Coventry and creating a lower demand for school reception places. Councillors at Coventry City Council this week were told after several years of expanding primary schools, things are now moving in the opposite direction due to lower birth rates. A report to an education and skills meeting on February 1 said it is a trend which “is forecast to continue” – but the authority has not disclosed the city’s birth rates, despite being asked multiple times."
1,"The kinds of new parents who have STD coverage provided or administered by MetLife may be different from parents in the general population. But, if the birth rate for the entire U.S. population fell 20%, that would imply that the 2021 drop in the number of births could be over 500,000 — and possibly larger than the drop the Brookings analysts have predicted. That would imply that the United States could record only 3.3 million births, much lower than 2018 or 2019."
1,"When it comes to the importance of newcomers’ contributions to our economy, the facts are clear. Because of Canada’s low birth rate and aging population, it is only through immigration that Canada’s population has continued to see substantial increases, unlike its Group of Seven counterparts, where population growth is declining or even negative. Make no mistake: Population is a fundamental building block for an economy."
1,"He suggested the need to continue encouraging civil servants to take days off to build a society that is more conducive to paternity leave. The government has been encouraging men in both the private and public sectors to take child care leave, but the practice is not widespread in Japan, a country with a declining birth rate. The health ministry reported the highest ratio among eligible male staff at 59.2 percent."
1,"We know that a teenage pregnancy has a major risk of complications, putting both mother and baby at risk,"" said Tania Marin, MSF Regional Medical Coordinator for Mexico and Honduras. The adolescent birth rate in Honduras is higher than the region's average and more than twice the global average, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The minimum age for legal sexual consent in Honduras is 14."
1,"Regulations put in place in 2017 in western China stated that all ethnic groups were required to implement a family planning policy that permitted couples in cities to have two children and those in rural areas three children. Use of contraceptives, tubal ligation and intrauterine devices resulted in a decrease in the birth rate from 1.6% in 2017 to 1% in 2018. Population growth rates fell from 1.1% to 0.6%."
1,"Deaths also overtook births for the first time, pushing the island's overall population down 0.2 per cent to 23.56 million, the interior ministry said. Taiwan's birth rate has been falling continuously since 2000, a period where wages have remained stubbornly stagnant. Demographers say Taiwanese women are increasingly getting married at an older age, opting for smaller families or choosing to stay single."
1,"In the court case, the American Chemistry Council, an industry group, challenged a decision by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to add a warning of developmental harm to the product labels. The office relied on a 2008 report by the National Toxicology Program, a federal health agency, that said exposure to high doses of bisphenol A during pregnancy can reduce survival of newborns and affect their birth rate and early growth. It was largely based on studies of rats and mice, and concluded that such harm was ""possible"" in humans."
1,"Further research at the Guttmacher Institute found that 34% of American women have reduced the number of children they expect to have or have delayed their plans to have children due to the pandemic. This wasn’t just a phenomenon seen in the U.S. Francesca Luppi, Bruno Arpino, and Alessandro Rosina looked at the impact that the virus had had on birth rates in Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the UK. They concluded that many people had decided to postpone plans to have children or had made the decision to have fewer children."
1,"Whereas LDS families two generations ago often had four to six kids, this new generation is often choosing to have two or three, Perlich said. Perlich expects a rebound in Utah's birth rate when this latest wave of young adults begin having children as the economy improves. But, she said the overall decline is a significant, legitimate trend that policymakers in Utah are largely ignoring because they get fixated on the fact that Utah has the highest birth rate in the country."
1,"Sales of pregnancy tests and pregnancy vitamins in Germany jumped in the last few months, according to a poll conducted for pharmacy news service Apotheke Adhoc. The bigger the economic fears, the bigger the impact on the birth rate,” said Martin Bujard, deputy director at Germany’s Federal Institute for Population Research. So in countries where the welfare state minimises the economic impact – like Germany – there might be less of a negative effect.”"
0,"The only reason that some people didn't want me to succeed was because I was a Black man."" Aaron held the record for 33 years until Barry Bonds passed him on Aug. 7, 2007, and although he is currently second on the career home runs list, behind Bonds' 762, the taint of the steroid era leaves Aaron in many people's minds as baseball's last legitimate home run champion.

0,"Henry Louis Aaron wasn’t just our icon, but one across Major League Baseball and around the world."" Aaron blasted 755 home runs in his amazing career that also contributed to the era's civil rights advances, President Joe Biden said.

0,"At what should have been the pinnacle of his long career in baseball, Henry Aaron was getting bags of hate mail — many containing death threats — and living in a storage room at the stadium, accompanied by bodyguards when he ventured out. It was 1973, the country remained divided along racial lines, and Aaron, a Black player for the Atlanta Braves, was closing in on Babe Ruth’s holy career record of 714 home runs. To some, it was sacrilegious that a Black man would threaten the record of the immortal Babe."
0,"For the next six years, Aaron and third baseman Eddie Mathews combined to become the greatest slugging teammates in baseball history, and the Milwaukee Braves, only two years removed from relocating to the Midwest from Boston, would become one of the powerhouse franchises in National League history. In 1959, Hank Aaron and Milwaukee Braves third baseman Eddie Mathews led the majors in home runs and batting average. For the next six years, they became the greatest slugging teammates in baseball history."
0,"His peers, of course, knew all about that, but the flamboyant Willie Mays was doing all those things too, and doing them with flair — losing his cap, making basket catches, diving for balls that were routine outs — and doing them on the grand stage that is New York, and later San Francisco. Even as a home run hitter, the young Aaron was often overshadowed by Mays, Stan Musial, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris. Occasionally his own teammates, such as Eddie Mathews and Joe Adcock, seemed to steal the show."
0,"Not long ago, he and I were walking the streets of Washington, D.C. together and talking about how we’ve been the best of friends for more than 60 years. Then Hank said: ‘Who would have ever thought all those years ago that a black kid from Mobile, Alabama would break Babe Ruth’s home run record and a Jewish kid from Milwaukee would become the Commissioner of Baseball?’ He will be missed throughout the game, and his contributions to the game and his standing in the game will never be forgotten.”"
0,"At the time Aaron's induction percentage was the second highest in baseball history to Ty Cobb. During his pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run record, Aaron faced jeers from the crowds, hate mail and even death threats as White Americans were outraged that a Black man was breaking Ruth's record. Aaron refused to let the negativity bother him on the way to the home run record, but felt that Braves fans were either indifferent or hostile to him as he closed in on Ruth's record."
0,"ATLANTA — His name is all over the baseball record book and, indeed, Hank Aaron could do it all. Sure, he's remembered mostly for dethroning the Babe to become baseball's home run king on the way to 755, but don't forget about the .300 average, or the graceful way he fielded his position, or the deceiving speed he showed on the basepaths. Yet when talking about the true measure of the man, there was far more to ""Hammerin' Hank"" than his brilliance between the lines."
0,"Aaron and his wife, Billye, began the Hank Aaron Chasing the Dream Foundation in 1994. It set out to award scholarships to 755 recipients, a number equal to Aaron’s home run total, although that has since been far surpassed. The foundation has since been transformed into the “44 Forever” program, which honors Aaron’s jersey number, runs in perpetuity and provides 44 members of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America scholarships worth up to $2,500 apiece each year."
0,"Aaron reached his career numbers by being remarkably consistent and never spending a day on the disabled list. He is the only player to hit at least 30 home runs in 15 seasons and is one of only four players to produce at least 17 seasons with 150 or more hits. On Aug. 1, 1982, Aaron was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, having received 97.8% of the votes cast by baseball writers, far exceeding the 75% necessary for election."
0,"He was unable to eat in restaurants or stay in hotels with his white teammates and was subjected to taunts and racial slurs, not only from fans but fellow ballplayers as well. He dealt with it all in the way he knew best, batting .362 with 22 home runs and 125 RBIs, earning the league’s most valuable player award. He went to spring training with the major league club in 1954 and, after having played in the infield all his life, was moved to the outfield."
0,"But it is his 700 15th home run on April 8th, 1974 for which he will be remembered most home run. That was the home run, which broke the record previously held by Yankees legend Babe Ruth. But what should have been the crowning achievement in his major league career was instead filled with hate and anger on the way to one of the most sacred of baseball's records, Erin received death threats, thousands of pieces of racist hate mail."
0,"It didn't seem to give a damn about the Braves, and it seemed like the only thing that mattered about the home run record was that a nigger was about to step out of line and break it."" Because of the pressure and racial backlash, Aaron biographer Howard Bryant told National Public Radio the historic home run was ""not a happy moment at all."" Aaron said he kept some of the hate mail he received to remind him of the reality of racism."
0,"Aaron was more relieved than happy, saying he felt that “the weight of a stove” had been taken off his shoulders. By then 40, Aaron hit only 18 more home runs that season, then was traded to the Brewers, a struggling team in a Milwaukee market still soured by the Braves’ move to Atlanta. The Brewers needed a drawing card, and Aaron fit the bill nicely for two seasons, ending his big league career where he’d long ago started it."
1,"It was while the Sun and RVS teams were working together on that campaign that someone mentioned the RVS’ next project would require thousands of people signing up to support the vaccine rollout and Newton thought “that's what we need to do”.

0,"The only other team that has been given better than 20-1 odds of winning next year’s championship is the New Orleans Saints, who have perhaps the biggest hole to fill of any team in the NFL this offseason. Longtime quarterback Drew Brees has likely played the last game of a Hall of Fame career, although unfortunately for fans in the Big Easy, Brees’ swan song was yet another disheartening playoff defeat, this time against the eventual champion Buccaneers in the Divisional Round. Although he hasn’t officially announced his retirement yet, Brees recently agreed to reduce his salary from $25 million down to the veteran’s minimum, freeing up a ton of cap space for New Orleans to utilize this offseason."
0,"And I think that is symbolic somehow. Because of Manning, I was inspired to write “an open letter” to our quarterback following the heartbreaking loss in Super Bowl 48, which brought me to Mile High Report and ultimately allowed me the opportunity to cover Super Bowl 50 - the game that turned out to be Manning’s golden swan song. So I feel like my opportunity to write about my favorite team is indelibly linked to Peyton Manning, and I am fortunate enough to have a bunch of memories with No."
0,"Case in point with the Indianapolis Colts and their quarterback conundrum. Ever since the sudden retirement of Andrew Luck, the ongoing debate of what to do long term at West 56th Street has continued, and recently it reached an unnecessary crescendo with the swan song season of Philip Rivers, who wasn’t the right guy to begin with as much as he was the best available veteran. His deal was just for one year, and while it was without question a cost- prohibitive one, the bigger problem is it delayed the inevitable for another season and put the franchise even further behind in terms of developing Luck’s replacement."
0,"The most surprising thing about this is that by the time a third Deadpool would have been in development Hugh Jackman had very publicly retired from the character. In fact his swan song was sandwiched between the two Deadpool movies, released in 2016 and 2018 respectively. Jackman and Reynolds have maintained a jokey ""feud"" online in the years since they both appeared in the Fox X-Men movies, so it's not too difficult to imagine the Deadpool star being able to convince him to return for this sequel."
0,"And boy, it wasn't a minute too soon. The potential swan song for one of the league's most prolific passers was an awkward record scratch of a performance: 19-of-34 passing, 134 yards, a touchdown and three killer interceptions, including one that essentially iced the game for the Buccaneers. Mike Edwards sends Drew Brees into retirement with this interception."

0,"He’s always had the structure of violent certainty, but not the soul of it. Now worn, wise, and not lacking in horse meat — Overeem’s swan song could be a title shot, or it could be a title shot that never comes. There’s no shame in that."
0,"“Americans are deeply disappointed and hurt by the way they’re treated by what they see as the power elite in Washington, D.C., and that goes across party lines and it goes across democracy,” Steyer said. “If this is a banana republic with a few very, very rich people and everyone else living in misery, that’s a failure.” It was a far cry from January, when Steyer went to Des Moines, Iowa, to announce that he wasn’t running for president and said he would focus his efforts on urging impeachment."
0,"Other skippers never so honored must stand in a longer line — similar to the one outside of Walmart on Black Friday.

0,"The slander reveals a faulty understanding of banana republics and of democracy in America,” said the top US diplomat, a staunch Trump loyalist, as two other members of the cabinet resigned over Wednesday’s violence. In a banana republic, mob violence determines the exercise of power. In the United States, law enforcement officials quash mob violence so that the people’s representatives can exercise power in accordance with the rule of law and constitutional government,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter."
0,"Snatching of ballot papers, attempting to disenfranchise voters by getting the Assin North MP out of the chamber, attempting to compromise the secrecy of the ballot, the entry of the military of the chamber. That is an abomination, it makes us look like a banana republic. Because you [MPs] were there, and you were emotionally charged, I am sure the infamy of that event did not strike you but when you see it on TV again, you will see how low our democracy has sunk under this presidency.”"

0,"In typical Banana Republics the huge and sprawling residences and production units of the high and mighty, invariably indulge in theft of utility facilities and taxes with issuance of SRO's, the burden of which is passed over into the bills of the poorest of the poor, even living in the ghettos: and to cover up their smart moves, a propaganda is unleashed that very few persons pay taxes in the country. Further, the hitmen of the Banana Republic excellently use their brains to serve their masters and befool the masses by ingenious ways of deception. Moreover, like devaluation of currency, the amnesty schemes, theft of utilities, issuance of SRO's and loan waivers increases the number of poor persons living below the poverty base line: and similarly increases the number of persons legally living above the ultra rich category, who only pay 10% of the tax revenue compared with 17% share of the poorest 10% in Pakistan, just because indirect taxation is above 80% and direct taxation less than 20% in Pakistan."
0,"In the days since the violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, liberal political leaders (Representative Seth Moulton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) and journalists alike (Kevin Cullen, “Three weeks in January,” Metro, Jan. 22) have used the derogatory phrase “banana republic” to describe the scenes of unrest and of troops being called in to protect our democracy. The phrase “banana republic” was coined by American author O. Henry in 1904, to describe a fictitious country based on Honduras, a country essentially run in the first part of the 20th century by the US corporation United Fruit, backed by the might of the US military. What we call “banana republics” are creations of American economic and political power."
0,"In covering U.S. foreign policy, the two regularly argued about the incessant wars and golpes in the Caribbean and Central America, particularly the revolutions of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Back then these governments were popularly labeled “banana republics.” The origin of the epithet stemmed from the region’s economic dependency on the export of this fruit and other commodities such as coffee and sugar as dictated by U.S. financiers and corporations such as Chiquita (formerly United Fruit) and Dole dating back to the early 20th century."
0,"The term stuck. Banana republics over the years have come to symbolize in the white supremacist imagination all the exploited smaller Black and brown nations of the world and their bandidos that rise up. What is clearly missing is the entire story — they rise against imperial states like the U.S. that get their way, through subversion of democracy when a people’s chosen leader is not convenient to American corporate interests."
0,"In fact, the historical record shows that America is the original banana republic, and for the last four years in particular, under a reckless president, it has profited from the cultivation of one crop: racism. It is time we retire the use of the racist term “banana republic” to describe what happens in places where the U.S. has worked to deny citizens democracy and where people rise up to defend it. Instead, let's use it to describe Trump’s America of 2021, where thousands of Republican Party bandits, led by a Republican bandit president, want to end democracy."

His story racked up over a million views in days."
0,"If good cops ignore the bad things they see, do good cops even exist at all? Rather than making the entire LAPD perfect angels who band together to fight one bad apple, the series acknowledged that they are all bad apples to an extent.

The Colne division in East Lancashire was one of the first to get the revived community constables."
0,"The panda is distinct from the ""area car"", a larger and more powerful vehicle which acts as support to the beat constables, usually carrying two officers.  Current usage within the Metropolitan Police Service uses the term ""panda car"" to refer specifically to a marked car driven by a basic driver (i.e., one constrained to drive within normal traffic rules, and who may not use the vehicle's siren).  This contrasts with an IRV (immediate response vehicle) which could be exactly the same vehicle but driven by a response driver (i.e., one trained and permitted to disregard certain traffic laws and use the siren, as one would normally expect from police vehicles)."

The Australian lungfish is one of the closest living relatives to those pioneering sea creatures, and because it’s remained largely unchanged by evolution for well over 100 million years, its genome potentially preserves insights into that key period."
