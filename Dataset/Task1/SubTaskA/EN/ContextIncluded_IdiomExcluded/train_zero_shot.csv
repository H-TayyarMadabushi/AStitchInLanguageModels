1,"We came out feeling entirely stuffed, and welcomed the walk home, but we'd had an indulgent time, watching the world go by whiled away in a cosy and friendly little nook. Another nice thing about Double Dutch is that they are an independent business run by a husband and wife team, offering something a bit different to locals and visitors alike. On our visit the staff were very helpful and attentive throughout and service was reasonably quick, doubly impressive when you consider how busy the place was."

1,"The authors report that 230Th was missing in multiple layers of sediment cores from the Arctic Ocean and Nordic seas, which suggests that no 230Th was produced at these time points, therefore indicating an absence of salt water. They propose that this region was filled with fresh water between 70,000–62,000 years ago and approximately 150,000–131,000 years ago, and that these changes occurred over relatively short periods of time. The authors suggest that at the time when fresh water was present, the ice shelves extended into the Nordic seas, and might have dammed these bodies of water, preventing inflows of salty water from the Atlantic Ocean."
1,"The agency that is behind the rising sea levels is simply an excess of fresh water from melting glaciers − about 350 billion tons of it. Fresh water is less dense than salt water, and so in regions where an excess of fresh water has accumulated we expect a localized rise in sea level,"" says Craig Rye, an oceanography researcher at of the University of Southampton in the UK, who, with colleagues, has published the findings in Nature Geoscience. Partly because the oceans are warmer and are therefore expanding, and partly because the terrestrial glaciers are in retreat, global sea levels on average have crept up by about 3 millimeters a year."
1,"Michael Hightower, Program Director of the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium at New Mexico State University, stated about a decade ago that operators were using about 15% reused or produced water on average, but that rate could have increased to as much as 80% in recent years. Due to the lack of adequate reporting requirements, it’s virtually impossible to determine at this time exactly how much fresh water is used in hydraulic fracturing today. In furtherance of this desire to push environmental policy by limiting oil and gas activity, Senator Antoinette Sedillo Lopez introduced a bill (S.B."

An early goal from Edin Dzeko and second deep into injury time from Alvaro Negredo settle a feisty affair at St. James' Park.

That looked set to be that but, with four minutes of injury time nearly up, Fraser was adjudged to have fouled Bardsley and, from the free-kick, Vydra fired in a close-range equaliser.

You don’t have to be familiar with the film’s turbulent production history to recognize that “Chaos Walking” has been compromised to the breaking point of basic coherence, as this prefab chunk of post-apocalyptic pablum shares its horny teenage hero’s ritualized determination to smother its true ideas and intentions under a layer of white Noise. And, much like Todd Hewitt — yes, this is an epic sci-fi story about a kid named Todd — “Chaos Walking” is very bad at doing that."

The basic idea behind a white noise machine, aka sound machine, is to emit a constant and consistent sound environment. This makes random and sudden bursts of noise, such as a car horn or people shouting in the street, less jarring and more manageable."
0,"That's a good thing, because if you're trying to concentrate, relax or get to sleep then variety is not necessarily what you want. Right now we're enjoying the white noise of a river near us: its constant motion creates a kind of white noise that means we don't notice the sounds of nearby traffic even though we're right in the middle of a city. If you look at the sound wave of that river you'll see it's fairly consistent, and that consistency is much more soothing than the big peaks and troughs of a car alarm or our upstairs neighbour's dubious music choices."

White noise can help you focus if you're trying to work somewhere with a lot of distracting background noise going on, and many tinnitus sufferers find it helpful too.

0,"Despite our wealth as a society, average working people must worry that losing a job might result in their families losing access to health care, or that an unexpected medical problem might result in bankruptcy or the loss of a home. From this standpoint, the health care question isn’t one of simple number crunching (although the number crunching does suggest that a universal, single-payer system would be most affordable), but one that is more philosophical: In a modern society, should health care be a source of security or insecurity? If it is universally available despite one's job status or economic status, that availability is a source of security."
0,"It turns out the differential stiffness and contraction make it possible.” To reach this conclusion, the team combined experimental research with number crunching, devising a mathematical model that demonstrates how a circular rubber band with two stiff regions can contract to four corners while in a “highly damped environment,” as the authors wrote in the study. The researchers had recently discovered two stiff and two flexible regions wrapped around the circumference of the wombat intestine."

Just to understand how dangerous alpha particles could be for our body, read the following statement taken from Wikipedia: ""Because of this high mass and strong absorption, if alpha emitting radionuclides do enter the body (if the radioactive material has been inhaled or ingested), alpha radiation is the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of radiation poisoning."

The £12m LongOps project is also aimed at automating aspects of nuclear fusion energy production, alongside decommissioning goals."
1,"The Committee will undoubtedly agree that the danger presented by modest radiological sources that are comparatively easy to obtain is significant as well. The impact of radioactive material release in a populated area would vary depending on a number of factors, such as the amount of material released, the nature of the material, the details of the device that distributes the material, the direction and speed of the wind, other weather conditions, the size of the particles released (which affects their ability to be carried by the wind and to be inhaled), and the location and size of buildings near the release site. Uncertainties inherent in the complex models used in predicting the effects of a radiological weapon mean that it is only possible to make crude estimates of impacts; the estimated damage we show might be off by an order of magnitude."
1,"State Department spokesman Ned Price said that the ministers emphasized the centrality of the transatlantic relationship in dealing with security, climate, economic, health and other challenges facing the world. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal quoted several diplomats as saying that the sites, where radioactive materials were found in Iran, increased suspicions, especially since the Iranian authorities had prevented international inspectors from accessing those sites for several months last year. Although the inspectors’ report did not clarify whether the suspected weapons development was recent, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Western intelligence agencies believe that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program until 2003, although Tehran denies any attempt to obtain such weapons."
1,"Clinicians who desire to use radioactive materials for patient applications need to apply for authorization from the Radiation Safety Committee. The Committee reviews the training and experience of the clinician with regard to the use of radioactive materials, the proposed use of radioactive material to determine that the work in within the conditions and limitation of the federal and state licenses, that the facilities and equipment are adequate to perform the work safely, and that the procedures are conducted to minimize the risk of the exposure and containment. Applications are available on the Authorization Process page on the Radiation Safety Office webpage and must be submitted to the RSO."
1,"Most detectors utilized in some way the ionization produced when these particles interact with matter. The increasing use of radioactive materials in various sectors like medical research, medical imaging, power production, industrial processes and the defense has raised a alarm regarding the health issues who are using them and who are exposed to them by one or the other way. Radiations can't be seen by our naked eyes and thus it can't be smelled so people working in radioactive environment should properly be dressed accordingly to the code and install the detectors at proper places so as to detect, monitor, and prevent direct exposure of harmful radioactive radiations."
1,"It’s important for Greenland to consider the experience of Malaysia and a rare earth processing plant operated there by another Australian company Lynas Corp Ltd, Chakhmouradian said. Faced with domestic pressure over environmental concerns related to the radioactive pollution caused by rare earth processing, Malaysia demanded last year that Lynas find another location for processing ores containing radioactive materials such as thorium. As part of the license, Lynas will have to build a cracking and leaching facility outside Malaysia before July 2023, after which the company will not be allowed to import raw materials containing naturally occurring radioactive material."

The overall mission of nuclear security — to make sure that no nuclear or other radioactive material and associated facilities are misused with malicious purposes — is a fundamentally unifying one,” said Buglova. To execute this mission, we need everybody from every country, language and culture; from every aspect of operations involving nuclear or other radioactive material, including operators, guards, contractors, janitors and cafeteria staff.”"
1,The classification deregulated or regulated applies only to Radiation Safety Personnel and to the final disposal of the waste. In all respects the generator of the waste shall handle all waste liquids containing any radioactive isotope(s) in any concentrations as fully regulated in the sense that all waste liquids shall be stored and labeled as radioactive material or waste. All liquid radioactive waste that is organic based will be collected and transported to the Radiation Safety Facility and processed for off site disposal.
1,"Old dumps can contain substances now banned or restricted such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PFOA and PFOS, all of which are extremely toxic to human health and the environment. There’s a huge variety of problems out there, ranging from asbestos to PCBs to radioactive material, to more recent chemicals like PFOA and pesticide waste that has been dumped in a large number of locations,” said Johnston. Liquid sludge could be anything from oily sludge to cyanide waste from metal plating operations.”"
1,"Consequently if you keep the object far enough (some meters) from where you live, sleep and spend most of the day, you should not have serious problems in the long term because of that nice instrument you have on your bookcase. However, as said, that depends from the amount of radioactive material contained in the instrument and the distance between you and the source. Obviously, if you collect WWII compasses and altimeters, it is better to check the intensity of radiation and to keep them away from your bed!"
1,"The Health Protection Agency urged anyone coming into contact with the cylinder to leave it where it is and alert the police. A spokesperson said: ""The radioactive material, believed to be Iridium 192, will not pose a risk to the public if it remains contained in its heavy lead container marked with the radiation trefoil. However, if the material is outside of its protection packaging, anyone who has come into prolonged physical contact, such as keeping it in a pocket, should seek medical assistance."
1,"It said that, over the past months, it has carried more than 600 tonnes of cargo including medicine, vaccines, personal protective equipment, microelectronics, mail and perishables. It also organised special freighter services for the government to carry 1,100 tons of additional medical supplies, radioactive material required for several treatments at Mater Dei Hospital, and other lifesaving medication. This year, it also carried the influenza vaccine."
1,"The gauge in routine storage does not pose a significant health hazard,"" Health Department spokeswoman Danyelle McNeill said in an email. Although the gauge poses a potential public health risk, it does not contain enough radioactive material to be used for any explosive device. The gauge transport case is about the size and shape of a storage trunk and is made of hard yellow plastic material with handles on each side and on top."
1,After one year the license is renewed for five years. The RRSC may revoke a radioactive materials license whenever individuals refuse to abide by the rules and regulations that govern the conditions of that license or whenever individuals habitually create dangerous or hazardous environments. An individual who has had a license revoked by the RRSC may not use radioisotopes until otherwise approved by the UAB RSO.
1,"Uranium in the water mixture is later extracted by ion exchange. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in February 2019 issued a radioactive material license to Uranium Energy for its Burke Hollow project, giving it the four permits needed for uranium extraction. The Burke Hollow project area is located in Belt, about 50 miles southeast of the company's Hobson Processing Plant in Karnes County."
1,"They may be too easily set off if they are installed too close to kitchens, or garages. Ionisation alarms carry a small amount of radioactive material between two electrically charged plates, which ionises the air and causes current to flow between the plates. When smoke enters the chamber, it disrupts the flow of ions, thus reducing the flow of current and activating the alarm."
1,"But the disposal of these submarines posed more problems than previous conventional vessels. Before crews could chop the vessels apart, the subs' reactors and associated radioactive materials had to be removed, and the Soviets didn't always do this properly. Mothballed nuclear submarines pose the potential for disaster even before scrapping begins."
1,"Brachytherapy, a form of internal radiation therapy, involves placing radioactive material into the cancer itself or into the tissue surrounding it. The implants are usually tiny steel capsules (“seeds”) about the size of a grain of rice that contain radioactive material. The seeds deliver most of the radiation to the area around the implant."
1,"For example, alpha radiation travels only a few centimetres in air, beta radiation travels tens of centimetres in air, and gamma radiation travels very large distances. All types of radiation become less intense as they travel further away from the radioactive material. This is because the particles or rays become more spread out."
1,"That goes back to understanding the early evolution of Mars, that time period when there was a lot of liquid water on the surface,"" Smrekar said. A higher concentration of radioactive material in the mantle would make that layer more active. More radioactive material in the crust could keep the planet's upper layers warm."
1,"He said the SWEIS needs to consider the safety impact wildfires have on pit production. He noted that, in the early 2000s, the Cerro Grande Fire almost destroyed 40,000 barrels of radioactive material, which could have contaminated the entire area. It's good for both the public and the lab,"" he said."
1,"Apparently you can omit it, but the clicking becomes much harder to hear. Even with no radioactive material around, you'll hear clicks occasionally from background radiation. But if you get the device near a smoke detector or a lantern mantle, you should hear a lot more clicks."
1,A higher concentration of radioactive material in the mantle would make that layer more active. More radioactive material in the crust could keep the planet's upper layers warm. Heat flow could also indicate how deep you'd have to drill into Mars to reach liquid water today.
1,"The injection may cause some slight discomfort. Allergic reactions to the radioactive material are rare, but may occur. For some people, having to lie still on the scanning table for the whole test may cause some discomfort or pain."
1,"We can't comment on the existence or nonexistence of any investigation,"" said Ryan Kennedy, supervisory special agent. Similar incidents of lost or stolen radioactive material have happened several times before in Arkansas and across the nation.

1,"The latest example involves the demolition of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Brookhaven, New York. Over the years, the lab has been on a mission to remove old buildings on its property that contain legacy radioactive material that was a result of past work at the site. Many structures have been removed or decommissioned over the years, but one high-profile structure has remained—a sizeable smokestack."
1,"It was only after pressure to find a solution that the CIAC announced an alternative season in the spring, joining 14 other states, nationally. But Lungarini said on Thursday that recent guidance from the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations deemed that states planning on playing an alternate spring football season would likely have to reduce games in the fall because of its policy on concussion and contact within a calendar year. Considering the impact that playing any games this year would negatively impact the following year when we anticipate being able to have a full fall season next year, was also a significant consideration by the Board today,"" Lungarini said."
1,"This is something players understand all too well, although they are not afforded the freedom to openly discuss it. What we have seen during this college football season is the worst of racial capitalism, a conspicuous and transparent attempt to steal wealth from Black communities in the midst of a pandemic that has already taken so much from them. Dr. Harry Edwards has recently referred to the practice of allowing Black participation in the previously segregated realm of white sport as “selective predatory inclusion,” by which he means inclusion for the purposes of ruthless exploitation."
1,"ESSEX, CHESTER, DEEP RIVER CT, — According to an article written by Sean Patrick Bowley, on Gametime CT's website, the alternative 2021 football season has been canceled by the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference's Board of Control.

1,"This week, the Los Angeles City section extended its spring season by two weeks, to the end of April, but LA County is even further away from reducing its cases enough to allow football under the current rules. The math does not add up to having a football season with much substance,” Walsh said. For now, at least, some teams have begun to practice again, albeit in pods while wearing masks and doing little that resembles football."
1,"Furthermore, almost everyone said they were fighting a losing battle. However, suddenly there were rumblings that Ohio State, Nebraska and Iowa were leading a charge behind the scenes to restore the football season. Eight Nebraska players filed a lawsuit against the Big Ten seeking to invalidate the cancelation of the season and to award damages, which was perhaps the biggest turning point in the entire ordeal."
1,"No one believes that is good, and the season certainly moved along in fits and starts but, gosh darn it, it’s all worth it to see the Crimson Tide or Buckeyes crowned as champion. As a counterpoint to that view I offer ... well, the entire college football season. College sports’ exploitative system became even more so when athletes were sent to play games during a pandemic so others could profit financially."

1,"While advocates believe this will be a net positive for consumers, there is also concern that opening up such data to hundreds of new organizations could result in higher rates of fraud, like identity theft, if they ended up in the wrong hands. Indeed, the evolution of security efforts in the U.K. tied to open banking provide an interesting case study for any public or private entity seeking to balance digital enablement with data security. Fraud analytics firm FCase has highlighted several areas where more widespread adoption of open banking might contribute to the fraud landscape, citing the sheer volume of data being shared among different parties, the inability of traditional fraud programs to parse through that data and heightened confusion around who is ultimately liable (the bank, third party provider or customer) when poorly secured data is accessed and abused by fraudsters."
1,"The winning case studies will be a perfect starting point for enterprises to evaluate what their industry cohorts have achieved by working with the right partner, as efforts turn to recovery.” An expert ISG digital review committee will conduct an objective, rigorous examination of each case study, including interviews with the customers involved and assessments of the impact of each transformation on the customer’s business.

1,"Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said of Santander's announcement: ""This will be disappointing news for those consumers who use high interest current accounts to earn a competitive return on their cash. Customers will now need to consider carefully if the monthly fee and cashback offer if still the best choice for them in light of the credit interest rate cut as there are alternative accounts on the market paying a higher credit interest rate. There is no telling how long a provider can sustain a lucrative package so it would not be too surprising to see other brands review their interest rates in the current environment."""
1,"A variable interest rate (sometimes called an “adjustable” or a “floating” rate) is an interest rate on a loan or security that fluctuates over time because it is based on an underlying benchmark interest rate or index that changes periodically. The obvious advantage of a variable interest rate is that if the underlying interest rate or index declines, the borrower’s interest payments also fall. Conversely, if the underlying index rises, interest payments increase. The obvious advantage of a variable interest rate is that if the underlying interest rate or index declines, the borrower’s interest payments also fall."
1,"Tenreyro said she did not want to prejudge the Bank’s review or whether the economy would need additional support but made it clear that she would be in favour of negative rates if the matter was ever put to the MPC. My overall assessment is that, while we can never have complete certainty, negative interest rates should with high likelihood boost UK growth and inflation. Cutting bank rate to its record low of 0.1% has helped loosen lending conditions relative to the counterfactual (of no policy change), and I believe further cuts would continue to provide stimulus.”"
1,"In theory, the comparison rate gives you apples where interest rates can deliver a mixed fruit bowl. The rate is calculated by adding the interest rate with all other applicable fees (for example monthly account, establishment, valuation and settlement fees) and representing this as a single percentage figure. A comparison rate is considered a more accurate reflection of the cost of a loan than the interest rate; however, it doesn’t cover government stamp duty, conveyancing fees, break costs or the cost of special loan features like offset accounts."
1,"The standard answer is that whether consumption goes up or down depends on whether the economy is “dynamically efficient.” This condition depends in turn on the relation of the interest rate to the growth rate. If the interest rate is lower than the growth rate, then the economy is dynamically inefficient, and while capital accumulation and output go down, consumption actually goes up."
1,"The existing securities in the account with the brokerage houses or merchant bank act as collateral, with the creditors reserving the right to sell the securities if the terms of the loan are not met.

From now onwards, stockbrokers and merchant bankers cannot charge more than 12 per cent per annum for such loans."
1,"In perhaps the boldest commentary on the surprise, BNZ research head Stephen Toplis said the inflation data, along with recent increases in world commodity prices, suggested annual inflation would “push above 2 per cent – and perhaps meaningfully so – before the end of 2021”.

From April 12, the bank has taken the decision to halve the interest rate from its current 0.6 percent, to 0.3 percent in a blow for savers. The decision, however, is just the latest in a list of changes the bank has made to the account in recent years."
1,"Therefore, for bonds that have a fixed rate, when interest rates rise to a point above that fixed level, investors switch to investments that reflect the higher interest rate. Securities that were issued before the interest rate change can compete with new issues only by dropping their prices. Interest rate risk can be managed through hedging or diversification strategies that reduce a portfolio's effective duration or negate the effect of rate changes."

1,"In the very aftermath of the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy , they surged, but after the panic phases ended, they were falling until the end of 2012, just when, more less, the bear market in gold started. Now, somebody could say that the real interest rates were falling for four years until reaching bottom at the end of 2012, so we shouldn’t worry about the normalization of interest rates. However, the COVID-19 related economic crisis was very deep, but also very short."
1,"Contributing to the rising urgency is a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trajectory that has so far shown few signs of abating, despite a succession of global climate agreements, as shown in Figure 1.

It read, ""Too many Americans are struggling to pay for necessities and to provide for their families."
1,"Still, the fiscal authority would probably get cranky if the monetary authority siphoned off anticipated funds by paying exorbitant interest on excess reserves. So even with interest rates that the Fed does “set,” there are countervailing forces that restrict its scope for administrative fiat. This doesn’t mean we should be cavalier about the Fed switching to a system where interest on excess reserves matters more than the fed funds rate."
1,"The Bank began emphasizing the target as its key interest rate in its communications with the public. Because the target affects the interest rates that financial institutions charge each other from day to day, it usually affects other interest rates, such as mortgages and consumer loans. The target for the overnight rate is also the most appropriate policy rate for international comparisons; for example, with the target for the federal funds rate in the United States and with the two-week repo rate in the United Kingdom."
1,"Second, the cacophony of ""Fedspeak""  — that is, speeches and interviews by Fed members —can often send investors in opposite directions. One way to cut through the noise is simply to focus on those speakers that are actually in charge of setting interest rate policy. In practice, this means paying attention to the Fed's Board of Governors and ignoring the regional Fed Presidents, who vote on a rotating basis."
1,"The APR is most often higher than the interest rate because your interest rate only tells you how much the loan will cost, without considering additional fees. While all these numbers can be confusing, looking at both the interest rate and the APR will help you score a better deal. If you're comparing two lenders, a lower APR indicates fewer fees, which means a lower cost for you over the life of the loan."

1,"The suggestion that the incubation period may extend up to 24 days is definitely worrying, especially for people currently in quarantine who may, therefore, expect to spend longer in isolation.

The Sydney hotel quarantine scheme has been called the ""gold standard"" in the country, but no system is perfect, Dr Stanaway said."
1,"There is also evidence claiming that the incubation period can be extended up to 27 days. There is one piece of evidence regarding asymptomatic cases claiming that the incubation period for an asymptomatic patient is 19 days. Regarding an incubation period of as long as 24 days, the World Health Organization mentioned in a press release that such a long incubation period is more likely due to a second infection rather than a continuation of the first infection."
1,"In a statement, NSW Health said the case demonstrated the importance of day 16 testing, which was introduced across the state last week. Such testing may pick up infection that has developed from exposure during the quarantine period or in those rare instances where cases have long incubation periods,"" a spokesperson said.

1,"The category of ""brain death"" is seen as problematic by some scholars.   For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: ""By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant ""brain-dead"" women)."
1,"The American horseshoe crab has outlived the dinosaurs and survived four mass extinction events, but its population has been devastated in recent years, partly due to harvesting for biomedical production. The blue blood of the fossil-like creature is the only natural source of limulus amoebocyte lysate, a clotting agent that is used to test batches of injectable drugs for bacterial contamination that could cause fever, organ damage and even death. The crabs are fished from the oceans, taken to a lab to have about 30% of their blood harvested, then released back into the wild."
1,"The alarm isn't in their nine eyes, nor their inky, wiggly 12 legs or even their menacing-looking tail jutting out from a protective helmet. The horseshoe crab's blue blood is used to detect toxins in the medicine. Their blood is hyper-sensitive to dangerous bacteria and traps it."
1,"The biotech blitz to stop the spread of the coronavirus has conservationists worried about a little-known front-line worker: the horseshoe crab. The creature's milky-blue blood is a key ingredient in tests used to ensure drugs aren't contaminated with endotoxins that could turn otherwise curative medicines deadly. Hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs are harvested off the Atlantic coast annually to make limulus amebocyte lysate, or LAL, tests, thousands of which are required to ensure the safety of each injectable drug or implantable device brought to market."
1,"A battle for their survival rages on,” by NJ Advance Media’s Michael Sol Warren: “The animals are critical to the work of pharmaceutical companies, especially during this pivotal mass distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. The crabs’ milky blue blood has been used for decades to detect harmful pathogens in medicines, allowing drugmakers to ensure their products are pure before being shipped out and injected into human arms. But harvesting the skeletal sea-dwellers isn’t without consequences, especially along the Delaware Bayshore in South Jersey where a long-fought battle between industry and conservation groups rages on.”"

It is estimated that 1.7 billion trips will be taken during the Spring Festival travel rush period this year, with an average of 40 million passengers per day, up more than 10 percent from 2020, according to the Ministry of Transport on January 20."

The reduction in prices of nucleic acid testing will help further ease the public pressure on testing, Zeng Yixin, deputy a director of the NHC, told a press conference of the State Council on Wednesday. As an important part of epidemic prevention and control, China has always attached great importance to the nucleic acid testing and its accessibility."

By the end of 2020, more than half of China's provinces had lowered the prices of novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing in public hospitals. Against the backdrop of sporadic outbreaks in some parts of the country and the travel rush for the upcoming Spring Festival holidays, the demand for testing is expected to reach a historical peak, industry experts said."

1,"Furthermore, because some patients with infectious diarrhea should be isolated to prevent pathogen transmission in hospitals, more prompt and accurate methods are needed to detect crucial gastrointestinal pathogens. The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (Verigene EP test) (Luminex Corporation) is an automated system based on microarray technology that enables simultaneous detection of enteric pathogens faster (3 h or less, including handling time) than conventional stool culture3. Since only a few previous studies have investigated the utility of this test3,4, and epidemiological differences affect the performance of diagnostic methods5, we conducted a multicenter evaluation in Japan to assess the ability of the Verigene EP test to detect crucial enteric pathogens."
1,"Often it was utter chaos, sometimes it was divinely inspired and for the vast majority of attendees, it was incredibly liberating to “freak freely” with others who felt the same. While no mere audio recording could ever capture an Acid Test experience, this one does manage to capture some of the spontaneous free-formlessness and remains one of the earliest (if not the earliest) examples of a live Grateful Dead recording, when they were essentially still a cover band playing for dancers. The recording begins with the proceedings just getting underway and not surprisingly, plenty of chaos onstage."

It feels like there is still a lack of understanding about what truly accessible accommodation looks like and we need universities to do more than pay lip service to it.

0,"It's clear from these FOIA releases that the FAA, state and local authorities in Colorado, and even the AFOSI, took the sightings quite seriously, but it appears that their attention quickly shifted elsewhere once the public reports stopped. Given the FAA conclusion that there is ""high confidence these are not covert military activities,” it is difficult to make a case that the mystery drone activity could have been some sort of classified test or black operation. There always remains the real possibility that the drones could have been operated by a hostile actor, whether homegrown or foreign, or some rogue hobbyists with considerable resources."

Eager to get another look, the CIA sent its industrial experts on another black operation to photograph the craft’s equipment markings, which they hoped would divulge clues about Soviet space production. But when the exhibition moved to yet another city—one source says it was in Mexico—the satellite had a 24-hour Soviet guard."

0,"Uday was seen as an “extreme playboy,” Woods says, noting how image was everything for his young guerrilla fighters, some of whom had been recruited as young as age 10 into the Ashbal Saddam, or Saddam’s Lion Cubs. While the black operation uniforms were reserved for the battlefield, the paramilitary unit would often dress in all white, the Middle East death shroud, likening themselves to martyrs for parades, or even stormtroopers. It’s like they were saying, ‘We’re so tough we’re ready to go and die right now,’” Woods explains."

Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary who is one of Leadsom’s most high-profile supporters, said she was “genuinely mortified” but added he believed “we’ve had a real black operation to denigrate her”. Eric Pickles, the former cabinet minister who is supporting May’s bid, said he did not believe Leadsom’s campaign was irrevocably damaged, though he said she had had what could “charitably be described as a disastrous start to her campaign” with her motherhood comments and questions being raised over her City career."

Of course, black ops has always been a favored term to use for those oh-so-secretive missions of the highest priority…giving people the impression that anyone involved with a black operation must kick a lot of butt.

1,"They then applied advanced methods from economics to quantify the relationship between historical precipitation variations and historical flooding costs, along with methods from statistics and climate science to evaluate the impact of changes in precipitation on total flooding costs. Together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S., and that exceeding the levels of global warming agreed upon in the United Nations Paris Agreement is very likely to lead to greater intensification of the kinds of extreme precipitation events that have been most costly and devastating in recent decades. Previous studies have analyzed pieces of this puzzle, but this is the first study to combine rigorous economic analysis of the historical relationships between climate and flooding costs with really careful extreme event analyses in both historical observations and global climate models, across the whole United States,” said senior author and climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, the Kara J Foundation Professor at Stanford Earth."

With two wins in their pocket, and inspired by case studies from Barcelona, Cuba, and Japan, the Jackson team went on to garner a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, as part of a $3 million initiative to bring the most impactful ideas from abroad to address the intertwined issues of health, equity, and climate change in U.S. cities. Using data gathered over the course of 2020, the city of Jackson can now work closely with its frontline neighborhoods to develop a series of design and planning meetings that will ultimately inform the types of interventions the community desires."

1,"Given that Trump had established himself as a climate denialist well before the 2016 election, it was also not surprising that his team ensured that references to the climate crisis were wiped from the site on day one of his presidency. The Biden administration has now taken the same step in the other direction, affirming the new president’s acceptance of the latest science on climate change.

1,"The extra time in the forest gave them added time for reflection, some of the fruits of which appear in a piece published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, part of a special issue on global insect decline. Their contribution draws on data collected since the 1970s on insect abundance and diversity in the tropics, as well as on observations about climate change that go back even further. Although the ACG's protected status has effectively eliminated certain threats to biodiversity loss, such as fire, hunting, deforestation, and pesticide use, the creatures that dwell there are not exempt from what Janzen and Hallwachs call the ""heterogenous blanket"" of climate change effects."
1,"In some circles, there have been arguments that, well, losses are increasing because we’re just building more stuff and putting more stuff in harm’s way, so things are becoming more expensive because we have a higher propensity to build structures in places that are vulnerable,” he said. Those circles include the likes of climate policy researcher Roger Pielke Jr., who has testified about climate change on Capitol Hill. Swain said that it is “true to an extent, but this model isolates climate just the contribution to these losses from the physical hazard itself changing.”"
1,"The Paris climate treaty signed in 2015 is a voluntary agreement, which relies on global advocacy to pressure countries into honoring their commitments. Adaptation financing is currently far short of what experts say is needed, at $30 billion per year, or only 5% of the total fund set aside to tackle climate change. The latter itself is deemed too little to ward off the risks posed by climate change."

For all those talents, Shakey is the archetypal backroom boy, the kind of man that doesn’t seek the limelight, that doesn’t need to be out front and centre but instead is happy to be working away diligently in the background, getting the job done. Perhaps he’ll surprise us one day by taking on a managerial role, but if I was Dan Ashworth, once the dust settles from the Allardyce fallout, I’d be doing my best to persuade Craig Shakespeare to come back into the international coaching fold."

Balmond finally cast off his image of 'backroom boy' when he acted as the co- designer for a series of temporary summer pavilions which have been built each year since 2001 beside the Serpentine Gallery in London's Hyde Park.

After all, the measure of a backroom boy may be the power he has, but the distinguishing mark is that he wield it unofficially and unpublicly. Thus it is impossible to demonstrate that, for example, Duncan has affected the composition of the National Gallery collection, or has nudged the Toronto Gallery purchasing committee into occasional shows of boldness or even that David Milne wouldn't have been accepted as a genius without him."

1,"The extension of the dry season increases the overlap of California’s wildfire season and the influx of the Santa Ana winds, which bring hot, dry weather to the region in the fall and can fuel more intense fires. The study did not directly link the rainy season shift to climate change, but the authors argue that the results are consistent with climate models that predict drier autumns for California in a warming climate. It’s not just a matter of making the vegetation drier and keeping all else equal,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study, told the American Geophysical Union about the new findings."
1,"We extract about 600 metric tons of waste daily from the Tullahan, and at this rate, we expect to extract 100,000 metric tons in a month’s time. The relatively dry months of January to May gives us an opportunity to intensify the cleaning, deepening, and widening of the river so that more areas can avoid flooding risks during the rainy season,” he said.

1,"The security situation shows no signs of improving. The declining number of attacks we are currently seeing is due to the rainy season which makes movement near impossible, so the insurgents are restricted to operating in smaller areas, and along the coast,” says Jasmine Opperman, an analyst with the Armed Conflict Location and Events Data Project (Acled). While there have been no direct attacks on the vast LNG infrastructure, it was touch and go in December when insurgents clashed with government forces around Quitupo village and reportedly came within 1km of the airstrip."

They then used a satellite measure of vegetative greenness, known as NDVI—which researchers and aid organizations commonly use as a proxy for crop stress—to examine the relationship between the onset of the rainy season and crop production, particularly in regions with the highest risks of food insecurity. Coauthor William Turner, a graduate student researcher at the Climate Hazards Center, investigated metrics from the start of the rainy season and began to uncover the relationship between when the rains arrived and the NDVI."

1,"In the new study, researchers analyzed rainfall and weather data in California over the past six decades.

1,"Wildfires can occur at any time in California, but fires typically burn from May through October, when the state is in its dry season. The start of the rainy season, historically in November, ends wildfire season as plants become too moist to burn. California’s rainy season has been starting progressively later in recent decades and climate scientists have projected it will get shorter as the climate warms."
1,"The onset of the rainy season has been progressively delayed since the 1960s, and as a result the precipitation season has become shorter and sharper in California. The new study in AGU's journal Geophysical Research Letters, which publishes high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences, is the first to quantify just how much later the rainy season now begins. The results suggest California's wildfire season, which has been getting progressively worse due to human-caused climate change, will last even longer in the years to come and Californians can expect to see more fires flaring up in the month of November."

Yet even as the abortion movement lost ground in the courts, it made major gains elsewhere, argues Ms. Hogue; the movement expanded its level of popular support and destigmatized a medical procedure traditionally seen as taboo — even among some Democrats. Polls show that mainstream views on abortion are more moderate than those of the activists on either side, with most Americans now saying that abortions should be legal with some restrictions.)"

While there has been much written about the influence of arcade games on popular culture, a new book is honing in on a small but vital detail of the gaming experience: the pixel typeface.

1,"The new year is a good time to focus on paying down credit card balances accrued over previous months, particularly during the holidays, even if, like many Americans, you are carrying less credit card debt than you were before the pandemic. Over all, American credit card balances dipped 13 percent from the end of 2019 through the third quarter of 2020, as consumers spent less and whittled card debt during the pandemic, according to federal data. Requests for help with credit card debt typically spike at the start of a year, according to Money Management International, a nonprofit credit counseling agency, but “we have not seen the normal increase we would have seen,” said Thomas Nitzsche, a spokesman for the agency."
1,"And the ongoing rewards rat race—which sweetened the deal for both existing credit users and new applicants—plus new products that might reach customers previously averse to credit, combined with less strict lending guidelines, encouraged usage as well. Despite the aforementioned overall uptick in card spending, credit cards will likely take a hit from customers looking to limit the debt they're incurring amid the ongoing pandemic: Mastercard, for example, saw US credit volume plunge 12% in Q3 2020, compared with 4% US combined credit and debit growth, which aligns with the results of major issuers. Further, customers have less of an incentive to spend with credit cards."
1,"While this type of debt is a common financial burden across generations, it’s generally discussed as the result of irresponsible and overly materialistic youthfulness. That reductive trope skips over a lot, namely that credit card companies have a history of taking advantage of young people who have little financial experience, so much so that federal regulations have been passed to curtail credit card companies’ more blatant and harmful practices. Though student loan debt (and its possible cancellation) dominates much of the national conversation, data shows that credit card debt is also a major financial hurdle for many young people."
1,"US and Canadian credit cards operate quite similarly — you swipe (or tap or insert) your card to pay, you have a grace period to pay your bill, and you get charged an interest rate for any balance you carry over past your due date. But US credit cards tend to have more generous rewards programs, fewer annual fees, and lower interest rates, so some Canadians may have considered adding an American card to their wallet, either for travelling in America or using at home. If you use an American credit card outside of the US, though, you could get hit with a foreign transaction fee, so consider credit cards with no foreign transaction fees."
1,"Some typical travel protection benefits include trip cancellation and interruption insurance, trip delay insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, baggage delay reimbursement, rental car insurance, travel accident insurance and emergency evacuation insurance. Not every credit card has all of these benefits, and the type of protection that’s most useful to you will vary depending on your situation. For example, if you fall ill prior to a covered trip and can’t travel as a result, the trip cancellation and interruption insurance on a credit card can help you out — even if the airline itself won’t reimburse you for the tickets."

And the firm added that cardholders are currently incentivized: Its data found more than half (or 53 percent) of cardholders say they would consider getting a new card or switching credit cards, if they could earn more rewards. At 41 percent, 'earning better rewards' is the top reason cited for wanting to get a new card in the year ahead, among those who plan to do so,"" according to GigaPoints."
1,"If you already have debt from past credit card use or some other loan, and the interest from that debt is making it difficult to get your head above water financially, having a credit card that allows you to consolidate your debt might be the best New Year’s present you could ask for. Some credit cards, when you first get them, offer what’s known as an introductory interest rate on balance transfers. That means if you transfer your existing debt from another credit card or other type of loan to your new card, you’ll pay no interest on that debt for a preset period of time — usually between six and 20 months."
1,"Attorney General William Tong and Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull are reminding residents that Connecticut law does not allow businesses to charge customers a surcharge for using a credit card after a recent increase in complaints. Local officials said the law does allow a business to offer a discount if a customer chooses to use one type of payment, such as cash, over another type of payment, like a credit card, but receiving the discount is not the same as adding a surcharge. If the final receipt shows a discount, it complies with Connecticut law."

The credit card statements include some $163,000 in charges from 2014 to 2019, with many receipts missing. The statements show expenses such as a $1,520 hot air balloon ride in Napa in 2016; $1,102 for transportation in Wine Country in 2018; a $2,805 charge at a cooking school in 2019; a Netflix account; a Costco membership; groceries at Safeway; and an Amazon Prime account."

1,"Despite the aforementioned overall uptick in card spending, credit cards will likely take a hit from customers looking to limit the debt they're incurring amid the ongoing pandemic: Mastercard, for example, saw US credit volume plunge 12% in Q3 2020, compared with 4% US combined credit and debit growth, which aligns with the results of major issuers. Further, customers have less of an incentive to spend with credit cards. Rewards do still give customers some impetus to spend on credit, since their importance as a savings tool has magnified this year."

1,"Keep in mind that one of the main benefits to reading your credit card statement is, it is one of the best ways to catch unauthorised charges and billing errors. Don't check your credit card statement for your balance and payment information, review the entire statement to verify your account activity. By routinely checking your online or physical statement, you can also find out well before hand if your credit limit was lowered since you last checked – as it can change because of your credit habits or your credit history."
1,"The most common types of rewards include cash back or travel points or miles, but there are other options as well. Merchants generally aren’t allowed to charge you more for using a credit card to pay for your purchase instead of cash or a debit card, and you’ll never pay interest on a credit card as long as you pay your bill in full every month. That means if you’re doing it right, there’s absolutely no reason to leave money on the table with a debit card when a credit card is giving you something back for no cost at all."

As a brewer] you could make the case for moving into a highly saturated area like Jack London or Temescal,” he said."
1,"Part of the reason Ghost Town is able to offer beer at such prices is because it maintains tight control over production and distribution. It does all its own brewing and all its own delivery, which is no small feat considering production has nearly doubled since Nosh first wrote about Ghost Town in 2018. It now sells its beers as far north as Windsor in Sonoma County, as far south as San Jose, and east to Sacramento."

On the other hand, Shanghai does not currently require foreign employees to contribute towards social insurance. Since all regional authorities have not implemented rules in accordance with international social security agreements – which increases the difficulty in obtaining exemptions – employees from countries that have agreements with China are eligible for social insurance exemptions."

The review was specifically targeted at health competencies within the social insurance system; for this reason, other forms of care covered by Federal and Lander governments, were only examined where directly applicable. The review can be broken into four interconnected components, each led by a separate organisation: International Comparisons and Policy Options; Legal Analysis; Stakeholder Submissions; and Situational Analysis."
1,"History and political economy theory suggest that this is unlikely to happen. Of course, we should not dig a deeper hole for our descendents to fill, but it seems more profitable to focus on gradually reducing social insurance benefits and controlling costs than attempting to improve social insurance funding. Professor Shaviros argument that deficits are unlikely to reduce the overall size of government, if we take into account the redistributional effects of massive intergenerational transfers, is provocative and certainly could be correct, but the calculus is complex and largely ignores the role of individual autonomy."
1,"First, measures are needed to ensure people feel safe to resume overall economic activity so that job growth accelerates. Second, household financial resources must be bolstered by the social insurance system, including unemployment insurance, in order to support their spending while the economy is weak and in order to support a more robust economic recovery. Third, overall job quality must be improved including protection for workers who would be at risk as they return to jobs and the assurance of a fair, living wage."

Simply put, can we imagine the U.S. Congress sitting on a public surplus of $10 trillion in order to smooth out the social insurance cost bubble? I think it is extremely unlikely that surpluses would survive to meet the social insurance funding needs of future generations, and I suspect most taxpayers and voters would share my cynicism.56"

1,"Firstly, the employer’s mandatory social security payments for its employees can be treated as reasonable salary expenses and thus can be deducted from corporate income tax. Secondly, social insurance can protect businesses from risks and save costs in certain circumstances. For example, where an employee suffers an injury or illness at work or during work time, the work-related injury insurance can cover the costs of the treatment."
1,"Hence, the legal status of the parties requires determination according to the circumstances of each case, with particular regard to the legal system, social background, and degree of freedom pertaining to the celebration of marriages prevailing in the country concerned. In countries with no restriction on the celebration of marriages in accordance with Jewish law, whether recognized – or allowed – by the state without or only after a civil marriage, the absence of the Jewish ceremony can be considered a clear expression of the parties' intention to be married only in accordance with the secular law, and therefore they are not to be considered married under Jewish law. Consequently, neither Jewish family law or law of inheritance will be applicable to the parties, nor any branch of Jewish law whose operation is dependent upon the existence of a valid Jewish marriage between them."
1,"In the case of a Jewish couple married abroad in a civil ceremony, the Israeli Supreme Court has yet to rule definitively on the validity of such a marriage. Instead, it has adopted an approach whereby the legal consequences of the civil marriage are determined under civil contract law and the doctrine of ""Good Faith."" Thus, a civil court may decide on the financial ramifications of the civil marriage, such as alimony and division of assets, including property, based upon the intent of the parties and principles of good faith, even without necessarily addressing the legal issue of the couple's marital status."
1,"The county has seen increased demand for its online marriage certificate services after the recent recognition of a handful of remotely issued Utah certificates by the Israeli government. The move is monumental for Israel, which does not permit civil marriages within the country. In the past, couples who did not want or could not be married in a religious ceremony, such as those who are LGBTQ, interfaith or nonreligious couples, have had to travel outside of the country to be married civilly before bringing back their civil marriage license to register with Israeli officials."
1,"It is hardly coincidental that one of their number (Moshe Gafni MK of the United Torah Judaism party) has chaired the Knesset Finance Committee in the last three governments, thereby enabling them to maintain control of the purse strings and hold the nation to ransom. Ever since its establishment we have lived in a country in which there is no civil marriage or divorce for Jews, and in which those immigrants who are not recognized as Jewish cannot even marry, but are forced to go overseas to do so. However, it took the corona crisis to make the pot boil over."
1,"Unlike a civil registrar wedding, it is entirely personalised and reflects the humanist beliefs and values of the couple. In England and Wales more than 1,000 couples a year already have a humanist wedding, but without legal recognition, they must have a separate civil marriage for their marriage to be legally recognised. This means couples must go through the formalities twice and have to pay for two ceremonies, as well as having the distress over their humanist wedding not being recognised as their real one."
1,"The system as it is does not allow you to be a person that has no religious attachment,” he added. Ultimately, while the couple’s move “may be an incentive toward the implementation of civil marriage in Lebanon ... from a legal and practical perspective, even if we would wish the contrary, it will be limited to a media propaganda,” Mattar had told The Daily Star even ahead of Charbel’s Monday remarks. Indeed, the publicity surrounding the issue has brought debate on the topic back into the public sphere."
1,"In December 1992, British Prime Minister John Major announced Diana and Charles formal separation in Parliament and on August 26, 1996, Charles and Diana officially divorced. Charles and Camilla married in April 2005, in a civil marriage at Windsor Guildhall, which was followed by a televised Anglican blessing at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. While it can never be said for certain whether Prince Charles loved Princess Diana, it can surely be concluded that it was Camilla he was destined to be with."
1,"The review makes several recommendations, which include a legal requirement to civilly register marriages and to increase awareness campaigns and educational programmes for both women and sharia councils. The first recommendation is a legislative change to ensure that civil marriages are conducted before or at the same time as the Islamic marriage ceremony. This proposed amendment to the Marriage Act 1949 would bring Islamic marriage in line with Christian and Jewish marriage in the eyes of the law."
1,"This proposed amendment to the Marriage Act 1949 would bring Islamic marriage in line with Christian and Jewish marriage in the eyes of the law. This is arguably the most important recommendation put forward; senior consultant lawyer Aina Khan OBE says that ‘by linking Islamic marriage to civil marriage – as happens in all Muslim countries – Muslim women are given the full protection of civil family law’. Accordingly, a greater number of women are expected to face less discriminatory practices."
1,"She will share how she and her husband moved from debt to financial stability, and offer practical advice for managing finances. That same night, there will be an event in Spanish on moving from civil marriage to sacramental marriage that will be hosted by Deacon Franklin Mejia and his wife Wendy of Sacred Hearts Parish in Malden. There are a number of people who end up getting civilly married, and then, for whatever reason, it doesn't happen in the Church."
1,"Under article 79 of this code, civil marriages executed overseas are recognized and governed by the law of the state in which they were conducted, but no mention is made of civil marriages in Lebanon. Effectively, this means that where civil marriage is concerned “there is an empty space that is not filled by laws,” he said. If you want to apply the civil marriage law [of Lebanon], there is no civil marriage law,” Mattar continued."
1,"During this period, the law served that purpose. Numerous republican and democratic laws were abolished, like the laws on civil marriage and divorce. Abortion was severely punished."
1,"The more popular argument for exclusion in 1996 was one endorsed by the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate Majority Leader, all of whom were supporters of DOMA and were critical to its enactment. The defense of marriage argument was that “homosexuals” might be nice enough, but allowing “them” into civil marriage would ruin that institution for everyone else. However popular this argument was, it had a huge problem: Why would marriage decline or collapse because LGBT people were welcomed into its fold?"
1,"The move is monumental for Israel, which does not permit civil marriages within the country. In the past, couples who did not want or could not be married in a religious ceremony, such as those who are LGBTQ, interfaith or nonreligious couples, have had to travel outside of the country to be married civilly before bringing back their civil marriage license to register with Israeli officials. The pandemic, of course, severely limited couples’ ability to travel outside of Israel for such marriages."
1,"In January 2004, AFSC also affirmed its support for civil marriage equality: “We minute our support for equal civil marriage rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people equal to those for heterosexuals. We are aware that many are calling for civil unions for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and some people wish to reserve civil marriage for heterosexual couples alone. It is our belief that government sanction should be applied equally."
1,"The religious ceremony has to be performed after the civil ceremony (never before). The minister, priest or rabbi will require a certificate of civil marriage before any religious ceremony takes place,” the French Embassy also said. We’re told Kimye’s French marriage will be legally recognized in the United States."

By physical, I mean the technical names of data elements and datasets, the technical names for databases and data transformations, and the jargon of programming languages like R and Python that end users and many IT staff have little or no knowledge of.

0,"Depending on the circumstances, a business could truly be worth far more than its owners' equity, as in the case of Apple, or if there's something fundamentally wrong with a business, its true value could be less than the owners' equity. The reason for this is that there's quite a bit of important information that a balance sheet and owner's equity doesn't tell us. For example, it doesn't tell us whether a business is profitable or not, what its operating margin is, or whether it produces positive operating cash flow."

0,"Fundamental analysts, when valuing a company or considering an investment opportunity, normally start by examining the balance sheet. This is because the balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's assets and liabilities at a single point in time, not spread over the course of a year such as with the income statement. The balance sheet contains a lot of important information, some of which are more important to focus on to get a general understanding of the health and dealings of a company."

Kristy Dillingham, coordinator of instructional programs for Santa Fe Public Schools and organizer of this year's county spelling bee, said the vocabulary rounds are intended to show whether the spellers truly understand the words and their proper usage."
1,"The Spelling Bee competition was composed of three rounds, 150 students participated in the first round, out of 50 students qualified for the second round, and then 12 for the third and final round. On the final round, the 12 finalists were each given 30 seconds to spell the words given to them, and the student with the most amount of words spelt correctly from a fixed set of words won the spelling bee”, pointed out Dr. Mackin.

1,"I think I speak for all of us, that we’d rather have a limited outdoor, like what we have, than nothing at all,” said Gary Hussey, a manager at The Smoking Gun in the Gaslamp Quarter. The Smoking Gun was a prime spot for football fans to watch the game Sunday afternoon. They had plenty of TVs facing the patio area."
1,"As with many artists, Bieber’s team had a rider sent out that let the venue know what Bieber would like to have backstage. When he was younger, his rider, according to The Smoking Gun, included simple items such as food, drinks, and necessary furniture. However, his 2017 rider was apparently way more extravagant."
1,"The Board also considered more recent events taking place in the Highland Capital Management, L.P. (also referred to as the “Debtor” or “HCMLP”) bankruptcy case, including a preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the “Court”) on January 11, 2021, enjoining and restraining James Dondero from taking a variety of actions, including making express or implied threats against the Debtor and its directors, officers, employees, professionals, or agents, in whatever capacity they are acting, and from physically or virtually entering the Debtor’s offices, computer, email, or information systems, including office space that the Debtor shares with employees of NexPoint Advisors, NexPoint’s investment advisor. The Court previously issued a temporary restraining order enjoining James Dondero from threatening the Debtor and its representatives after the Debtor accused him of the same and of interfering with the bankruptcy proceeding. NexPoint and NexPoint Advisors are also defendants in a lawsuit associated with the HCMLP bankruptcy."
1,"Weisbeck objected to the deal, in part because it includes a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement prohibiting members of the creditors committee from making the church documents publicly available. If you’re going to get the protection of a bankruptcy court from lawsuits, and as part of that bankruptcy proceeding, you’re required to turn over documents and information to creditors, that should never be secret,” said Weisbeck. That’s frustrating the intent of the Child Victims Act, which is not only to get compensation for people who were injured as children, but also to expose the wrongdoing of organizations that protected child molesters within their ranks.”"
1,"Diocese lawyers began handing over the files in December under the terms of an agreement that they hashed out with abuse survivors who make up the committee of unsecured creditors in the diocese’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, according to multiple sources. Whether the general public will be able to examine the confidential records someday remains unclear and likely will be subject to intense negotiations during the bankruptcy proceedings. In exchange for the records, the creditors committee agreed not to press forward with sex abuse lawsuits against individual parishes and other Catholic entities."
1,"If the applicant or the owner of the applicant is the debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding, either at the time it submits the application or at any time before the loan is disbursed, the applicant is ineligible to receive a PPP loan. If the applicant or the owner of the applicant becomes the debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding after submitting a PPP application but before the loan is disbursed, it is the applicant’s obligation to notify the lender and request cancellation of the application. Failure by the applicant to do so will be regarded as a use of PPP funds for unauthorized purposes."
1,"With Mallinckrodt now in bankruptcy, this agreement ensured $1.6 billion will be placed in a trust and used to directly address the pain, suffering and trauma they caused. We are also aggressively engaged in every aspect of Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy proceeding to protect and preserve every possible dollar for addiction science, treatment and recovery in Connecticut. That includes our vocal opposition to the deficient U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Purdue—a mere mirage of justice for the victims of Purdue's callous misconduct."
1,"You also could explore refinancing if it will help you lower payments or, better yet, convince the borrower to refinance and place the debt in his or her name alone. In extreme circumstances, if you've taken on more debt by cosigning than you can afford, you might have to seek bankruptcy protection; remember, however, that a cosigned federal student loan is unlikely to be dismissed in a bankruptcy proceeding. Depending on the loan and its terms, you may be able to be removed as a cosigner after a certain stretch of timely payments."
1,"Liftopia has the option to object going bankrupt under Chapter 11, a process that allows companies to remain in business while working on a way to satisfy their creditors. It also has 21 days from the June 2 filing date by Skico and others to respond before any bankruptcy proceeding can move forward. Involuntary bankruptcies are primarily filed against businesses, where creditors believe the business can pay its outstanding debts but refuses to do so for some reason,” according to Investopedia."
1,"They say, Thomas, ""has a command of the facts and can remember events from both the recent and distant past. Moreover, Mr. Girardi’s fluency with litigation matters undermines the movant’s contention that Mr. Girardi is unable to appreciate the bankruptcy proceeding or assist lawyers."" The firm went for his throat writing, ""In hindsight, it became clear to us that Mr. Girardi was engaged in a sophisticated scheme to use client funds for improper purposes, such as to pay off his own creditors."""
1,"One person who has worked with Apple described its secrecy requirements as a lot of hoops to jump through. In at least one case, Apple has threatened to penalize suppliers $50 million for each individual leak, according to a contract that became public as part of a bankruptcy proceeding by supplier GT Advanced Technologies. Some companies can engage in limited discussions of their business with Apple, especially if Apple has publicly talked about the relationship and approves."

Ultimately, you can obtain a dismissal of a foreclosure case while you are in bankruptcy."
1,"Both groups would have to approve a plan for Billings to continue cleanup efforts at the site, which sustained environmental damage while it was used as a fertilizer facility from 1954 to 2001. Farmland is selling the property as part of its bankruptcy proceeding, and the bankruptcy court must give final approval of the sale. As part of the bankruptcy process, the court allows other interested parties to bid on the property."
1,"It was a fair offer when we thought Heatway was going to win and we have not reduced our offer one penny, so it’s something we hope the court and creditors will look favorably on.” Fifer said he could not reveal the amount of the offer but that it would become part of the public record in the bankruptcy proceeding. Chiles said he’s been advised that, in terms of normal bankruptcies, Heatway’s will be brief and to the point."
1,"Current owner Samuel Wyly filed a motion Friday in his bankruptcy case in Texas for court permission to sell the bookstore. Unlike other assets owned by Wyly, the bookstore isn’t frozen as part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Wyly’s attorney contended in the motion. In this case, the debtor will be steadily working to monetize certain estate assets in order to satisfy the allowed claims of creditors,” Wyly’s motion said."
1,"If you want to keep your home when you file bankruptcy, you must file a reaffirmation agreement with the court. Essentially, a reaffirmation agreement states that you agree to the liability of your current mortgage regardless of the outcome of your bankruptcy proceedings. In other words, you simply keep making the payments on your house as if you had never filed for bankruptcy and hold on to your home."
1,"AMC has said it needs $750 million. And in the event of such future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our common stock and other securities would likely suffer a total loss of their investment,"" it said in the filing. The coronavirus pandemic has taken a steep toll on AMC and other leisure companies as lockdowns have kept people at home and sharply cut into the companies' revenue."

1,"Trump opened the former casino in 1984 at what was considered a prime location adjacent to the city convention center and near the Atlantic City Expressway exit. Billionaire Icahn took ownership in 2016 in a bankruptcy proceeding. He was unsuccessful in selling the property to Hard Rock International the following year, according to reports."
1,"The criminal charge against Kimball said he failed to disclose the transfer of money to a relative and the existence of a company he owned that was formed to conceal income from creditors. In his involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, Mr. Kimball did not adequately make full disclosures as required,"" said a statement by his attorneys, Hobbs and Marilyn Keller. He accepts responsibility and will cooperate in the pre- sentence report process as sentencing approaches."""
1,"A bankruptcy is also a legally binding process. You generally don’t get to keep your assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, but there are some important exceptions. For example, depending on what province you live in, you may be able to keep some of the equity in your home, your car, the savings in your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), or work-related tools."
1,"On January 13, 2021, NexPoint and NexPoint Advisors were temporarily enjoined and restrained from interfering with or otherwise impeding, directly or indirectly, the Debtor’s business, and from conspiring, colluding, or collaborating with James Dondero or any entity he owns and/or controls, to engage in such conduct.

Shareholders should be aware that they are not required to tender any Shares to NexPoint."
1,"Ok enough of that,having just retired & facing a significant birthday this fitted the bill,years of USA fly drives had left us pretty sick of flying,we felt we could just put up with the one flight without another to look forward to at the end of the holiday,just to make it extra special I had booked the Premium flights & a suite on board,all of which was unknown to my Wife but helped to build excitement nearer the time as she slowly found out finer details of the trip! Priority check in at Manchester & the so called Fast Track through security were disapointingly slow IMO,the security area seemed remarkably small & disorganised,but we survived & headed to Spinning Jenny for some breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed(we both had a regular breakfast which came on huge plates & looked lost but actually were very good!) before heading for our gate."

1,"Principal proposals of the plan include to better connect the outer commercial areas at Parsonage Retail Park and Leigh Sports Village to the heart to create `one town centre` experience and to provide significant environmental improvements within the residential neighbourhoods and prioritise quality safe access to the town centre and beyond. They also aim to break the dominance of traffic at Atherleigh Way, Spinning Jenny Way, Lord Street, Market Place and Railway Road to make routes across the town centre easier and more attractive to pedestrians and introduce a quality public realm and new open space into the heart of the town centre. Plans also look to promote new infill development and facilitate the redevelopment of vacant or under-utilised sites and premises."
0,"Hold on a minute! Whilst Manchester, and Lancashire more generally, did certainly make numerous important contributions to the industrial revolution (Arkwright's water frame, Hargreave's spinning Jenny, Kay's flying shuttle, Nasmyths works in Salford etc etc etc), I always thought that the Bessemer process was primarily developed in Sheffield, which is most certainly NOT in Lancashire. Its in Yorkshire (which is exactly the opposite of being in Lancashire)."
0,"Community rooms at the chapel would be transformed with exhibitions displaying a time when cotton production could not keep up with international demand. A working model of a spinning jenny, recordings of how the machine would sound in use and a heritage trail would bring the time of the invention, in 1764, to life it is hoped. Both the methodist chapel and residents are backing the idea which would use cash set aside for local projects."
0,"MUCH of the history I learned at school focused on the Industrial Revolution. From Abraham Darby's iron smelting triumph to James Hargreaves and his Spinning Jenny, via the waterways and the Age of Steam, my textbooks were filled with the captains and glories of industry. Growing up in Bradford, I was familiar with the wailing sirens of mills still chugging on in their final years."
0,"HONOUR The Rev Lindsay Pettigrew and Richard Hopper outside the Stanhill Methodist chapel A COMMUNITY group hopes to celebrate their village as the birthplace of James Hargreaves, the inventor of the spinning jenny, through a museum. The invention by the illiterate carpenter and weaver helped to spark the Industrial Revolution with its superior methods for producing cotton."
0,"Machines have made jobs out of date for quite a long time. The spinning jenny supplanted weavers, buttons uprooted lift administrators, and the Internet drove travel services bankrupt. One research assesses that around 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. processing plants from 1990 to 2007."

1,"All the gossip exchanged, the recipes swapped, the current events discussed, and just the fellowship of friends living during one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. Garby’s Bridge Club had played through the Great Depression, World War II, the Korean War, Elvis on Ed Sullivan, the Beatles in America, the 60s, segregation, Civil Rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the Reagan Revolution, the Dawn of the Information Age, 9-11, etc. And what of the tremors in their own lives?"

1,"The Brooklyn hip-hop duo Dead Prez have remained radical and unpredictable for over a decade. On their new studio album Information Age, Stic.man and M-1 scrap every compelling element of their music and go full Enya. It's hard to remain both strident and surprising: Usually one tendency erodes the other until you get predictable or go soft."
1,"To be prepared to win a war in the information age, the Army will have to change its foundational theories of warfighting, its institutional frameworks for developing combat capabilities, how it views risk, and how it generates combat power. These changes will include developing a theory for information age warfare, changing how it allocates risk between current and future forces, changing the roles and missions of its major warfighting organizations, changing its warfighting functions, and reimagining its approach to operational energy. Any one of these would be a formidable task, and yet to be successful the Army should tackle every one of them."
1,"Exams and homework are poor tools for assessing actual learning (ask anyone who crammed for an exam and promptly forgot what they memorized two days later). They incent finding the right answer – which is so easy in the information age – over actual learning. When during a sabbatical I worked as a Senior Policy Advisor in the US Department of Education, I asked the American Institutes for Assessment to provide us with a primer on assessment in higher education and the report concluded that much of higher education relies on mostly unsound assessment practices."
1,"This is both an attack on free competition and free speech, and no republic can support such evil. If even the president of the United States can be silenced by Big Tech, then the Information Age will likely sink into another dark age in the progression of human history. We will stand as brave Americans against the rise of corporate socialism and censorship by Big Tech and the mainstream media, or we will leave for our children and our children's children a future of secrecy, Orwellian surveillance, and the end of representative democracy as we know it."
1,"Clearly, transnational technology platforms not only influence politics and markets through actions of users they don’t control, but directly wield political power themselves. Human society has yet to completely adjust to these new power centres of the Information Age, and all states—from autocracies to liberal democracies—are in their own ways contending with the challenges of how to limit, constrain, regulate and harness them. The challenge for liberal democracies is particularly acute because Big Tech platforms affect cognition."
1,"The cancelation was announced a day after Fox, Mr. Dobbs and two other hosts were sued in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed on behalf of voting software company Smartmatic. One of the biggest challenges in the Information Age is disinformation,"" Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. Fox is responsible for this disinformation campaign, which has damaged democracy worldwide and irreparably harmed Smartmatic and other stakeholders who contribute to modern elections."
1,"Singapore is another country which has, over the years, come to signify the spirit and soul of the festival. With the advent of digital diplomacy shaping the global information age, countries and leaders are disseminating content that has both the domestic as well as international audiences taken into consideration. It was particularly noteworthy when Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong took to his Facebook page in 2018 to wish the vibrant Tamil diaspora in Singapore and globally for the occasion."
1,"He had many meetings over his years at State with Shevardnadze but did not lecture his counterpart about Soviet conduct in these sessions. More typical was his effort to persuade Shevardnadze that, as the world moved from the industrial to the information age, economies and military establishments would not be based on giant tank or bomber factories. They would be based on the flow of information, and the Soviet system was built around preventing exactly that."
1,"At the very heart of this transformation is a fundamental shift in where, how and when work gets done. The emergence of the information age and an exponential growth of digital technology has ensured that information is more readily accessible, while at the same time, our expectations have become more complex. Employees are demanding more of their employers and to allow them to manage their work and home lives with more autonomy."
1,"The complaint has been filed in New York State Court in Manhattan. One of the biggest challenges in the Information Age is disinformation,” said Antonio Mugica, CEO of Smartmatic, in a written statement. Fox is responsible for this disinformation campaign, which has damaged democracy worldwide and irreparably harmed Smartmatic and other stakeholders who contribute to modern elections.”"
1,"This would enable the Army to move beyond managing the problem of fighting a war with China or Russia, and begin transforming itself to remain preeminent. They entail a requirement to leave Iraq and Afghanistan behind intellectually and return to first principles, while implementing newly developed tenets of information age warfare. This list is not complete — it is merely a start."
1,"Eric Reisz, Lead Engineer, Panacea Technologies As regulatory agencies catch up with the information age, thoughtful data historization is becoming more vital to the normal operation of any good practice facility. Pharmaceutical companies now hoard truckloads of data, devoting significant resources and capital to ensure data integrity and 21CFR Part11 compliance."
1,"Their music perfectly embodies these universal frustrations, providing an outlet of pure anarchistic energy we can all mosh to. MC Ride is our Information Age muse, and his spasms of anger and moral decay are ultimately a reflection of society and ourselves. Those who don't recognize this value will continue being complacent in their auditory comfort zone."
1,"Building your business around a few major clients leaves you vulnerable if those clients stop doing business with you. We live in the digital information age. You can generate revenue offering courses, coaching, consulting, paid speaking, membership websites, paid webinars, books, digital information products, and paid content creation."
1,"It’s constantly changing. Thus, raising children in our information age’s chaotic maelstrom of ideas and values requires — you guessed it — parental guidance and wisdom as we intentionally help our kids consider which values to embrace and which to reject. Is Disney+’s decision to lock up ""Peter Pan"" for the littles asinine?"
1,"The battlefield operating system warfighting functions proved ideal for mechanized warfare. However, they have proven to be an impediment to organizing around the tasks required to dominate warfare in the information age. The challenges in organizing cyber are indicative of this."

Shelby was also the seminal advocate in the Senate for consumer privacy in the new Information Age. Way back in 2001, when few fully understood the issue, Shelby was insisting that banks and other institutions provide opt-out provisions for consumers who don’t want personal information shared without their knowledge or consent."
1,"India Businesses Most Bullish on Embracing Digital Ways of Working  In today’s Information Age, digital is the way to go - and businesses in the Asia Pacific and Middle East know this best. In its recent study, Cognizant experts said businesses in the two regions “are entering the next phase of relationship with technology.”"
1,"The second wave of human productivity came from the industrial revolution, which harnessed machines to perform repetitive tasks on our behalf. We are now in the third wave of human productivity: the information age. Like the machines of the industrial revolution, silicon chips are now automating and simplifying information-driven tasks."
1,"Only the passing of time informs how good or bad these decisions were – and even then, qualification is challenged by an avalanche of data, opinions, conjecture and interpretations that are at once compelling and contradictory. The coexistence of facts and alternative facts is the ultimate irony of The Information Age. As we enter 2021, and the Covid-19 fire continues to burn dangerously around the globe, it’s important to remind ourselves that, even as our asset markets make hay under a shining sun, the cinders of 2020 still smoulder here too."
1,"In particular, we needed to transform the way the department, the services, and our industrial base partners realize and field capability with software. Whether executing our day-to-day business operations or employing complex weapons systems on the battlefield, software is the foundation of information age warfare upon which the majority of our capability relies. To protect our interests at home and abroad and stand with our allies against terror and aggression, we started a revolution to become significantly more agile and responsive in our ability to leverage software."
1,"And then, of course, there's disinformation , that is spread deliberately for a number of reasons, including political propaganda. While Verge might not have intended to mislead in any way, this entire episode is an excellent example of how the spread of misinformation works in the ""Information Age"": For one, the headline, as we shall see, is typical of today’s time – the more sensational it is, the more likely we are to click on it (the neuroscience of which I will touch upon later). The headline also illustrates the importance of wording in communication."
1,"A decade later, thanks to the loss of prestige among legacy media, the rise of an industry of self- described news outlets dedicating to gulling conspiracy-minded dimwits, and the advent of billions of pocket computers that allow the least knowledgeable among us to communicate with their counterparts across the globe, we are all now engaged in an experiment in the effects of what one might term “elective truth.” Cavazzoni’s heroes are largely harmless, and most of them antedate the information age. Their charm lies in what the book’s translator calls their “beautifully hopeless enterprise.”"
1,"Capture App aims to create photos with a unique ""birth certificate"" that can verify their source   * The technique was pioneered by the Starling Framework, which used it to record accounts from Holocaust survivors   * If propagated, the technology could reinforce public trust in media distributed online A new application of blockchain verification hopes to solve one of the thorniest problems of the information age: verifying that media is from a reliable source and hasn’t been altered. A photo app called Capture App creates a unique “birth certificate” for every photo taken and stores it on a blockchain network, allowing its creator to claim ownership of the original and know if it's been copied or changed."
1,"Unable to physically answer the door (I was in another state), I chatted with the person, figured out what they needed, opened my garage door remotely and then watched them grab something I had left there for them. As we move deeper into the information age, we tend to take for granted previously unimaginable levels of knowledge and connectedness. I remember reading the Dick Tracy comic strip as a kid and marveling as he used his wristwatch radio."
1,"We debate, we discuss, we thank G-d for His blessings and we grumble about the bitter herbs, the staleness of our Matzah and the mountainous workload of incessant cooking and cleaning. Today we live in an era that has been dubbed by some as the ‘Information Age,’ and we face Jewish challenges that largely center around communication. These include the struggle to convey Jewish pride and identity to our children and to combat the ever growing tide of vile anti-Jewish and Israel hatred bubbling in the media, on college campuses and among diplomatic elites around the world."
1,"It is through this presuppositional bias, be it conscious or unconscious, where prejudices skulk. In the information age, it only takes a microsecond to appertain a person's or group's denomination, then into the caste pigeon-hole they go, never to be considered without bias again. In the United States, (an ironic and unpredicted oxymoron with unintended consequences) internal divisiveness has crept its way, or maybe charged into our lives through violent actions deemed virtuous by a group-think herd, incited, instigated and dispatched by the polarized extremists that command them along with the electronic news cycle that uses sensationalism and video bites for click-bait."
1,"As we freeze them on an altar of adoration, we run the risk of losing our critical perspective regarding who they were or are as full, complex human beings. In the world of social media and an information age with a 24-hour news cycle, heroes rise and fall in spectacular fashion on a daily basis. In the end, perhaps we will find it necessary to refuse rendering any individuals as heroes uncritically and instead settle on what we can agree about: There is an undeniable hero ism in refusing and transcending the narrow boxes that racism creates and the barriers it erects."
1,"Initially, custom code was the way to go, but as Rick Sherman of Athena IT Solutions once noted: ""Hand coding works well at first, but once the workloads grow in size, that's when the problems begin."" As the information age matured, a handful of vendors addressed this market in a meaningful way, including Informatica in 1993, Ab Initio (a company that openly eschews industry analysts) in 1995, then Informix spin-off Ascential (later bought by IBM) in 2000.Those were the heydays of data warehousing, the primary driver for ETL. Companies realized they could not effectively query their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to gauge business trajectory, so the data warehouse was created to enable enterprise-wide analysis."
1,"He explained that the technology is able to transmit video shots of very high quality, reliably and quickly, from a large number of cameras in real time, to monitors on the set, thereby providing the film's director and crew with full control of all shooting angles simultaneously. The Academy Award Committee stated in its announcement: ""By using novel extensions of digital data transmission and compression algorithms, and data prioritization based on error rate, the Amimon chipset supports the creation of systems with virtually unrestricted camera motion, expanding creative freedom during filming.""

1,"This year he will continue to focus on his career, his award show and start editing his new short film which will be out this summer. The Young Artist Academy Award winner takes this win as a token that no matter how dark times may be, there is always that light that shines the path. JAC won the award for a film with a story that gives hope to the unseen outcomes and that shows you that no matter what, you can't ever give up."

1,"Also, there are three levels of care, the primary, anchored at the local government level, while the secondary and tertiary levels are managed at the state and federal levels. So after the government commenced the health insurance for federal civil servants in 2005, it was expected to be replicated at the state level but unfortunately, most of the state governments did not follow suit, what the federal government now did based on the directive of the United Nations to all member states was that the government of all member nations must ensure the wellness of their people, by earmarking about 2% of their consolidated revenue for healthcare services for the vulnerable in their countries. This administration must be commended for that compliance because it has completely changed the narration of our health indices and healthcare services in Nigeria."

Given that health insurance is not mandatory in India and there is no government owned universal healthcare system like one in the European countries where very citizen is enrolled in the national healthcare system, it will be a great move if there are certain initiatives in place which encourage people to invest in health insurance. In developing economies like India, it has been often observed that measures taken by government play a major role in driving the buying behaviour of people."

0,"The study also found that nearly everyone’s sleep was affected by the pandemic in some way: one in six lost sleep, one in five slept the same amount but shifted their bedtime later, and one in four actually gained sleep. Those who slept more, Robillard said, may have a later “biological clock” that leads them to stay up later and, no longer having to commute in the morning, were able to sleep longer instead. People who shifted their sleep window later were more likely to be young, work remotely, and have no family members to take care of."

This type of field work could also be used to cover small posts guarding roads or bridges, provided the avenues of approach were restricted and the direction of enemy approach could be adequately predicted.

0,"This was given a sharper grade than the scarp since it only had to support the weight of the glacis, which was a cleared ramp that forced attacking troops to run uphill and into fire delivered from the parapet. Provided it was well placed, and its interior arrangements were properly constructed, artillery was a powerful accessory to the defense of a field work. Cannon could be mounted in a field work either on a barbette carriage, to fire over the parapet, or behind embrasures to fire through openings in the parapet."
0,"There were also weak points in the parapet where attacking troops could enter a work under cover of the cheeks of the embrasures. Artillery could be placed at any point along a parapet of a field work, where its fire could reach across the crest of the counterscarp. Howrever, it was best placed at salient angles, which jutted out from the main line, in order to reduce the number and extent of sectors without fire in front of the work."
0,"Bomb- and splinter-proof shields constructed in permanent fortifications such as forts Sumter and Pulaski were known as blindage. This form of screening was also used in field fortification to prevent an enemy from seeing into a trench or bringing accurate fire against a field work under construction.  During siege operations, blindage was particularly useful for covering saps exposed to defensive fire. Blindage covering the tops of saps could simply consist of sandbags, or a layer of fascines laid over the crest of the parapet."
1,"Field Work was Heaney’s first collection of poetry since his most celebrated collection, North in 1975. Field Work can largely be read as record of Heaney’s four years (1972-1976) living in rural County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland after leaving the violence of The Troubles. Heaney had previously been living in Belfast as a professor at Queen's University. Denis O’Donoghue has referred to this period as ""years of retreat only in the religious or monastic sense, a quiet time for thinking and renewal."
1,"Joshua Weiner writes: ""While the move south seemed to some a deliberate withdrawal from a previous political commitment to fight the British presence in Ireland, Field Work indicates rather a growing commitment to stay engaged, but to do so by maintaining the long view, which asks questions more than it assumes positions."" In a 1981 interview with Frank Kinahan, Heaney said Field Work ""was an attempt to try to do something deliberately: to change the note and to lengthen the line, and to bring elements of my social self, elements of my usual nature, which is more convivial than most of the poems before that might suggest, to try to bring all that into play. Dr. Rand Brandes tells the story of the title Field Work in The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney."
1,"Of course, because he is Seamus Heaney, the hard work pays off Field Work is a beautiful book of verse composed by the Nobel laureate at the pinnacle of his poetic career, inspired by the four years he spent in County Wicklow, a rural area south of Dublin, far from the incessant violence of Belfast, the poet’s home. The first third of Field Work is marked by poignant elegies to friends murdered during the Troubles, the wondrous Glanmore Sonnets constitute the middle third, and the final third features a series of deeply personal lyrics rooted in Wicklow’s rich soil."
1,"For me, as an Irishman living abroad, I like to read Heaney on my return. Field Work brought me back to my roots-my childhood and a stimulating new adult experience- and he surely has an especial charm for the Hibernian.  Yet, this work and others alike from the Nobel Laureate, deepen particularities and transcend them in a non-zero sum game."
1,"At one point, Heaney asks, “What is my apology for poetry?” For this reader, he need not defend his “trade,” to use Yeats’s term, whatsoever. In 1979, just after Field Work was published, Denis Donoghue of the New York Times wrote that “what is exhilarating in these poems [that is, the poems of Field Work] is the relation between their two musics: the music of what happens comes first, and Heaney listens to it, receives it as a gift, like the first line of a poem; the second music is what he makes of the first, taking it into himself and finding a voice for it there.” I have yet to find a better characterization of Heaney’s poetry in this collection.

Of course this was years before the Smoking Jacket Ban in 2007, and the jacket would never be allowed on the air today, but in those days Nelson cut a raffish figure, chatting up Elizabeth in a bored kind of way, and when she was a cub reporter at the Echo he always encouraged her during Bob-a-Job week.

1,"Known as the winter solstice, this is the time when darkness takes up as much time as it can before finally giving way to the increasing daylight of spring. But there's a lot more to the winter solstice than you may realize. Solstices are important astrological events wherein one cycle ends and another begins, and according to astrologer Emily Ridout, it's as much of a psychological shift as it is a seasonal one."
1,Lohri is a traditional winter folk festival celebrated in India by people specifically in the North zone. It is a festival of joy that commemorates the passing of the Winter Solstice and looks forward to longer days as the sun journeys towards the northern hemisphere. Lohri is primarily celebrated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent by Sikhs and Hindus.
1,"The winter solstice, when the sun appears at its lowest point in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere, will also be when it appears to be at its farthest southern point over Earth, located over the Tropic of Capricorn. As Dr. William Teets, the director of Vanderbilt University's Dyer Observatory, told the Associated Press, the winter solstice is the shortest day for those in the Northern Hemisphere, but oddly enough it's not the day with the latest sunrise and the earliest sunset (which actually happens two weeks before and two weeks after the winter solstice). What we will be witnessing will be caused by the Earth's changing distance from the sun, which is caused by our planet's elliptical, not circular, orbit, which also changes speed."

Beauregard Lee, Ohio's Buckeye Chuck, North Carolina's Sir Walter Wally, Louisiana's Cajun Groundhog, Alabama's Smith Lake Jake, Wisconsin's Jimmy and New York's Staten Island Chuck (full name: Charles G. Hogg). Groundhog Day's origins lie in the ancient European celebration of Candlemas, which is a point midway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox – the exact midpoint of astronomical winter. Superstition has it that fair weather predicted a stormy and cold second half to winter, as noted in this Old English saying:"
1,"The best place in the world to observe the winter solstice is at the prehistoric monument Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, believed to have been erected by ancient Celtic druids to line up the exact position of the sunset on the winter solstice. The winter solstice may explain why Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December. The Bible isn’t specific about when Jesus was born, and some people believe Dec. 25 may have been selected by Pope Julius I as the date of Christ’s birth to replace the ancient pagan Roman midwinter festival called “Saturnalia” with a Christian holiday."
1,"In the Southern hemisphere the opposite will be true, with the sun rising to its highest altitude, resulting in the longest annual period of daylight. The exact moment of the winter solstice varies from year to year due to a slight misalignment between the Gregorian calendar and the actual rate of the Earth’s rotation around the sun, but it usually falls on the 21st or 22nd of December. In Britain, the shortest day of the year lasts for just 7 hours, 49 minutes and 41 seconds."
1,"But according to Pennsylvania's Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog who scurried out around 7:25 a.m. Tuesday to predict the weather, the country is due for six more weeks of winter. The Groundhog Day tradition took hold in the U.S. with Punxsutawney Phil's 1887 prognostication, an offshoot of the Candlemas tradition, marking the midpoint between the winter solstice and spring equinox. In Germany, hedgehogs became a part of the tradition, making the first predictions for the winter."
1,"What is interesting is there is a scientific reason for the date Feb. 2, it is halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. The Winter Solstice is Dec. 21 while March 20 is the Spring Equinox. Now in Europe they actually used a Badger as a weather profit on this day but in the United States the Ground Hog was about as close to an animal they had and thus the Holiday Groundhog Day was born in 1886 in Punxsutawney Pennsylvania."

In the past, before the approach of the winter solstice, every household would make the cakes to worship their ancestors or use as gifts for relatives and friends. Today, though fewer families eat homemade cakes, people there still buy rice cakes for the Winter Solstice Festival."
1,"Even though the Northern Hemisphere is closer to the sun during the winter, it's the tilt away from the sun that causes cold temperatures and less light — which is when the Southern Hemisphere is toasty. So while our winter solstice is around Dec. 21, the Southern Hemisphere celebrates the same around June 21. Although the solstice is marked by a whole day on the calendar, it's actually just the brief moment when the sun is exactly over the Tropic of Capricorn that the event occurs."
1,"For John Beckett, a druid and coordinating officer of the Denton Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans in Texas, Imbolc’s association with purification — a Pagan spring cleaning — resonates at the end of a near-universally difficult year and the previous presidential administration. While many pagans planned cleansing and banishing rituals for the winter solstice in the final days of 2020, Beckett decided to wait until both the year and the administration would be gone. He has co-written a ritual of cleansing that Denton CUUPS will lead virtually this weekend."

There is no need for anyone to have 'Dutch courage' to say that the judiciary’s biggest credibility problem has been caused by some of its own decisions as well as the conduct of some of its own functionaries. Some of the recent decisions of even the Supreme Court, including the ones on the controversial new farm laws, and earlier the most sensitive Ayodhya dispute, have drawn suggestions of judicial overreach and populism."

0,"Besides, as Wycliffe Orinda told the magistrate’s court in Milimani, being high on alcohol can make anybody look attractive (no offence intended to his wife). Alcohol diminishes an individual's inhibitions by boosting self-confidence, a mental state known as Dutch courage. The increased sense of confidence makes it easier to approach strangers."

Of course the opposite of a low profile tyre is a high profile one, and the difference is visually obvious when the two are compared, because there's a lot more tyre sidewall before you get to the wheel. You'll normally find these on basic cars and 4x4s that need the extra height to protect the wheels from damage on rough terrain."
0,"The American casino operator said that although it remained committed to becoming a global gaming and entertainment player, it would “maintain a disciplined framework” when considering opportunities for expansion. Its withdrawal prevents it from returning with a fresh bid for six months unless another bidder enters the fray, although in practice the existing American joint venture between MGM and Entain acts as a poison pill, preventing other suitors coming forward for the FTSE 100 company.

The truth is, Seager might well have been traded already if not for a ""poison pill"" written into his contract that turns a $15 million team option for 2022 (with the potential to grow to $20 million through performance clauses) into a player option if he is dealt. It's doubtful many teams would want to take that on considering Seager's age, though a strong 2021 season might change that as the MLB trade deadline nears."

1,"And I think part of that is because a lot of games are expensive, and people want to know if they should buy them. But I think the other part of it is that we’ve spent so long having this weird set of unspoken rules around spoilers that the discourse around video games invariably does not end up focusing on things like themes, or what a game is trying to discuss, or what a game is about. Instead, in the absence of people’s ability to talk about particular story content, they are instead like “Well, let’s talk about mechanics."

1,"Road users adjusting to the new speed limits on State Highway 6 between Nelson and Blenheim say a few more minutes travel time is a minor inconvenience in return for a major drop in potential carnage. On December 18, Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) dropped the speed limit to 90kmh for most of the route, 80kmh in other sections, and down to 60kmh through the winding Whangamoa Saddle, in parts of Atawhai, north of Nelson, and around the Pelorus Bridge.

1,"First, as previously noted in an article by John Toussaint and an earlier piece that colleagues and I wrote, the fundamental problem facing private purchasers of health care is lack of market power. Though they collectively purchase insurance for over half of Americans, individual companies — and even small groups of companies as big individually as Haven’s sponsors — lack the leverage in local health care markets to force change on resistant local health care providers. There may be rare exceptions in company towns — Amazon’s home in Seattle might qualify — where a particular firm provides enough health care customers that hospitals and health professionals can’t ignore its demands."
1,"Toral focused on these categories of health care because he had access to monthly data and because the services are mandatory, so the changes were likely due to fewer services being available, rather than demand decreasing. But he hypothesizes that the delivery of other services, such as education, could be similarly suffering, since polls suggest that health care is the most important issue to Brazilian voters. Natália S. Bueno, assistant professor of political science at Emory University, says this is certainly possible, and thinks services that require a lot of frequent work from bureaucrats, such as services for the poor and for people with disabilities, could also be affected."
1,"There’s certainly every indication that Sanders intends to use his new role and the increased prominence that comes with it both proactively and aggressively. The senator dropped at least one significant hint to that effect in a recent interview, which saw him revive the idea of an emergency universal health care program — a popular and potentially transformative move that could provide significant and badly needed relief to millions of people. Though we don’t yet know the details of what Sanders will propose, it’s reasonable to assume it will resemble the legislation he tabled last spring alongside House colleague (and Congressional Progressive Caucus chair) Rep. Pramila Jayapal."
1,"Single sex athletics is rooted in the reality of biological differences between the sexes and is rooted in objective biological fact and fairness.” Meanwhile, New Hampshire’s HB 68 defines health care for young trans people as “child abuse.” Make no mistake: these bills target and attack trans youth and will cause them serious and lasting harm,” Caitlin Borgmann, executive director of the ACLU of Montana, said of the proposed bills in that state."
1,"One section of the proposal establishes a health care affordability account, where the Legislature could collect federal and state revenue to expand programs that increase affordability or access to health insurance. Another section of the proposal starts on that work by lowering prices for plans on the state's health care exchange and by expanding coverage to include some people who would otherwise make too much money to qualify for a subsidy. Yet another section requires lawmakers to apply for ""state innovation waivers"" from the federal government so the state could use federal health care funds to pay for the programs Washington wants to expand in the future."

In addition to the 7,500 health care workers, 14,500 fans will be in attendance at the big game. According to the league, ""the Center of Disease Control, the Florida Department of Health and area hospitals and health care systems ""reviewed and provided feedback on the NFL's comprehensive plans that will enable the league to host fans and the vaccinated health care workers in a safe and responsible way."""
1,"Sarasota Memorial Healthcare Foundation announced in a press release Thursday that more than $900,000 was raised at the annual hospital gala held Jan. 9, which will go toward SMH’s frontline health care workers. Philanthropy plays a critical role in SMH’s ability to deliver the very best health care to the patients we serve – especially during this most challenging time in our history,” David Verinder, Sarasota Memorial president and CEO, wrote in a prepared statement. We are so grateful to the Healthcare Foundation for hosting this fantastic event where year after year, our generous community shows their unwavering support that is so critical to our success.”"
1,"Even with that safety net in place, the Office of Financial Management estimates about half a million Washingtonians remain uninsured—down from nearly a million last May—including approximately ""125,000 undocumented immigrants"" who lack access to basic care, according to a new report from the state's Universal Health Care Work Group. On top of all that, analysts predict health care spending will continue skyrocketing, with costs rising on average twice as fast as wages. Probably the most galling part of that cost comes from paying health insurance CEOs millions of dollars to devise new and innovative ways to deny coverage to the poorest and sickest Americans."
1,"Randall said she feels more confident about bills that restore proposed programs Inslee cut at the end of last session, such as her bill to extend Apple Health (Medicaid) coverage for mothers for a year after the baby's born. Senate Majority floor leader Marko Liias said increasing subsidies, inserting intent language into the RCW, and continuing the work of the universal health care work group ""seem like the least difficult lifts"" at the moment, though he admits that challenges abound. Setting up a health care account in the treasury and figuring out how to cover all Washingtonians ""are the bigger challenges that cost more, but that's our mission,"" he added."
1,"On top of these obstacles, health tech innovators have to make sure they're creating programs in line with FDA and HIPAA regulations — and then navigating around challenging compliance and approval frameworks. With these obstacles in mind, we need to create conditions that allow us to harness the computing power already on hand to make AI strategically valuable for health care. Interestingly, the ongoing pandemic has accelerated the digitization and virtualization of health care provider infrastructures, compelling changes in everything from data management to computing to regulation that will ultimately drive AI adoption in health care."

1,"Obamacare failed on its many promises to lower health insurance costs and protect patient choice, and, unsurprisingly, Americans are looking to lawmakers to find better solutions to lower costs and expand their access to care. But instead of filling the top health care post with someone ready to do that hard work, Biden has put forth Becerra to fill the top health care post. While the current administration has been making gains to lower health care costs, expand consumer choice and restore Medicaid, Becerra has been making a name for himself as Trump’s health care nemesis and defending the law that he helped pass in 2010."
1,"Around the country, nurses are demanding that we go beyond the platitudes about “health care heroes” and commit to building a real national health care system, so that they are never forced to work in conditions like these again.8 Julie Keefe is a nurse at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn, and like Bazel and many other nurses, her frustrations with rationed protective equipment, short staffing, and the endless pressure to do more with less have brought her to the realization that the health care system needs radical change. For her, the months of March through May last year were a period of extended stress."
0,"According to history.com, the leap day was originally discovered by Egyptian astronomers, but this discovery did not reach the western world until Julius Caesar’s reign in 45 BC. Caesar then created the leap year calendar to fix the problem, which was later adapted in accordance with new knowledge about the earth’s orbit by Pope Gregory into the Gregorian calendar that we observe today. Feb. 29 happens every four years, because the earth technically requires 365.25 days to complete its orbit around the sun."
0,"Prior to this, most of the Roman world and Europe had used the Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 48 BC. In order to try and link the calendar up to the solar year (the time it takes for Earth to revolve around the Sun), the Julian calendar had a leap year every four years, in which an extra day was added. The problem was that since the actual solar year is 365.24219 days, the Julian calendar quickly (and by quickly, I mean incredibly slowly) gains a day every 128 years."
0,"It just means that a day is added to the month of February every four years to synchronize it with the seasonal or astronomical calendar as these events do not take place in a whole number of days. Precisely, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds for Earth to go about the Sun and not having a leap year means that after 100 years our calendars would be off by 25 days. Now another thing that comes to mind is the reason for calling it a “leap” year."
0,"In February and March last year, 593 speeding fines from ACT traffic cameras were issued with incorrect dates as a result of a ""systems error"". The error was a result of the issuing computer not being programmed correctly to account for the 2020 leap year. The fault occurred over 14 days from February 29 to March 13 but Access Canberra refused to reassess or reissue the infringements, describing them as ""valid for the purposes of the road transport legislation""."
0,Apparently women were also expected to have to wear either breeches or a scarlet petticoat to signal their intention. Another theory involves Queen Margaret of Scotland who allegedly put in place a law allowing women freedom to propose during a leap year but fined any man who refused them. This one is rather questionable however as Queen Margaret was eight years old when she died and scholars haven't located any record of the law.
0,"But what about metaphorical leaping, as in taking a chance, reaching for something just a bit outside my grasp – dreaming and then setting a big goal and actually going for it? Our presidential candidates take advantage of leap years in this way. The years give them an extra day to campaign and take a leap of faith that they will survive the long and grueling competition to be chosen by the American people as our nation’s leader."

Later, I came to know that they did celebrate their birthdays each year like everyone else on March 1, but the one that falls on a leap year is celebrated as a grand one which made me envious of them.

0,"While gaining an extra day this year seems little more than a fun fact, leap years have caused curious upheavals over time, such as the predicted leap year bug said to follow the Y2K controversy. The year 2000 is divisible by 4, which would qualify it for a leap year, but it is also a century year, which disqualifies it. However, it is divisible by 400, which, once again, qualifies it."

1," Blades are one of humanity's oldest tools, and continue to be used for combat, food preparation, and other purposes.  Blades work by concentrating force on the cutting edge.  Certain blades, such as those used on bread knives or saws, are serrated, further concentrating force on the point of each tooth. "
1,"Blades may be used to scrape, moving the blade sideways across a surface, as in an ink eraser, rather than along or through a surface.  For construction equipment such as a grader, the ground-working implement is also referred to as the blade, typically with a replaceable cutting edge.  A simple blade intended for cutting has two faces that meet at an edge."
1,"Cutting may be accomplished by single-point or multipoint tools. Single-point tools are used in turning, shaping, planing and similar operations, and remove material by means of one cutting edge.  Milling and drilling tools are often multipoint tools."
1," Grinding tools are also multipoint tools. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle), and shears a tiny chip.  Cutting tool materials must be harder than the material which is to be cut, and the tool must be able to withstand the heat and force generated in the metal-cutting process."
1,"Cutting tools are often designed with inserts or replaceable tips (tipped tools). In these, the cutting edge consists of a separate piece of material, either brazed, welded or clamped on to the tool body. Common materials for tips include cemented carbide, polycrystalline diamond, and cubic boron nitride."
1," The correct point angle for the hardness of the material influences wandering, chatter, hole shape, and wear rate. The lip angle determines the amount of support provided to the cutting edge.  A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under the same amount of point pressure as a bit with a smaller lip angle."
1,"Nakiri bocho are knives for home use, and usually have a black blade. The shape of the nakiri bocho differs according to the region of origin, with knives in the Tokyo area being rectangular in shape, whereas the knives in the Osaka area have a rounded corner on the far blunt side.  The cutting edge is angled from both sides, called ryoba in Japanese. This makes it easier to cut straight slices."

Coming out of the GNU, Zanu PF has retained all its dictatorial powers or be it with a small concession; the party allow the opposition to win a few gravy train seats to entice them to participate in the flawed elections to give the vote rigging Zanu PF legitimacy.

1,"Having a news environment in this country that is one that is sustainable and is supported commercially, then this is vital to how democracies function.” Microsoft is in an curious position as, while its Bing search engine could very easily replace Google in popularity in Australia if Google’ search engine was given the boot, it could also find itself in the same position that Google currently is in if it ever reaches anywhere near the same scale.

0,"The star player said he wanted to use his ""position of privilege"" to help others. I've earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order,"" he said. He added: ""Things in the media escalated and there was a general impression that the players (including myself) are ungrateful, weak and selfish because of their unpleasant feelings in quarantine."
0,"She says that’s not something that should be taken lightly after all of the thought and careful considerations that the country’s forefathers took as they drafted these important documents. The amendments in the Bill of Rights have worked for almost 250 years and helped catapult America to the top of the world pecking order and Hough sees no point in trying to change them now. According to her, many others purchasing their flags and banners feel the same way and Ultimate Flags is happy to help them express themselves."
0,"While the Nuggets offered Grant a comparable contract to stay, the forward’s role on the team would have looked a little different. With Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray ahead of him in the pecking order of scoring options, he likely would have been deployed for his defensive skills as opposed to his ability to create opportunities on offense. Grant has taken just over half the average number of shots he took in Denver, putting up roughly 17.9 field goal attempts per game versus the 8.9 he tried the season before."
0,"It has been reported that Texans owner Cal McNair has privately apologized to Deshaun Watson for the way he has handled things in terms of the GM hire and the head coaching process, but that hasn't stopped the rumors from circulating that the disgruntled QB wants out. On Saturday, Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald stated the Houston Texans QB actually has a 'pecking order' of teams that he would like to be traded to. And, yes, he really wants to move to the AFC East."
0,"He’s quick, and seems to have a great playmaking sense about him. Espinoza might just be the most likely of the three to become a regular starter, if he can prove to Raphael Wicky he’s ready to jump ahead of veteran Boris Sekulic in the right back pecking order. Offor, the Nigerian forward who spent time in the Latvian league, appears a bit raw, but seems to have an intelligent nose for goal, and should figure to be an exciting replacement for CJ Sapong."
0,"They perform menial chores and many are sexually abused. The rest fall into a broad category called simply the “men,” acquiescing to the gang leaders, refraining from cooperating with the guards and avoiding the abuse suffered by those at the bottom of the pecking order. A system of rituals keeps the hierarchy intact."
0,"Newcastle United and Leeds have also emerged as options for Tomori, but these reports suggest he is edging closer to a Serie A switch. Tomori has worked with Lampard at Chelsea and Derby, but the youngster has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. AC Milan’s director of football Frederic Massara is said to be a big admirer of Tomori, having tracked the versatile defender since his days at previous club Roma."
0,"Ireland must move up international rugby’s pecking order, Farrell says Andy Farrell has said Ireland need to aspire to move up the “pecking order” after admitting that England and France are favourites for the Guinness Six Nations. Ireland had to settle for third place in the 2020 competition having lost to Eddie Jones’ eventual winners at Twickenham in February and been beaten by Les Bleus in Paris at the end of October."
0,"Both loan players have a point to prove. Scott needs minutes to show she can still perform consistently at the top level, having slipped down the pecking order at Manchester City with the arrival of the US World Cup winner Sam Mewis. Lehmann has an opportunity to show she is deserving of a contract with a team battling at the top of the table rather than the bottom."
0,"Lossl has opted to leave this month, and not hold on until the summer, for the good of his international career with the delayed Euro 2020 tournament taking place in June. Lossl was pushed further down the pecking order at Everton following the arrival of Robin Olsen on loan from AS Roma in October. And with Carlo Ancelotti making it clear he hopes to sign Olsen permanently in the summer, Lossl's future chances were slim."
0,"The offseason addition of Tristan Thompson addressed a need for more length and strength on the interior. Even if it wasn't entirely clear how they would replace Gordon Hayward, the Shamrocks seemingly had a good feel for where they stood in the NBA pecking order. But the campaign hasn't been short on surprises, and that's no different in Boston."
0,"So I've had to keep a beady eye on them in case of any poultry shenanigans. Our Nancy is an uncomplicated character, she is not at the bottom of the pecking order so I'm not sure why she has been at the receiving end. She is a big fan of snacks so perhaps she'd overstepped the mark and elbowed a boss bird out of the way once too often."
0,"The deal was struck after West Ham agreed to a £1.5 million loan fee, according to The Guardian's Jacob Steinberg. The move is a fresh opportunity for Lingard to play regularly after falling down the pecking order under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season. Lingard was limited to just three appearances in all competitions."
0,"P.J. Tucker is Houston’s heart and soul, though he is accustomed to taking a backseat after spending so many years with Harden. More importantly, for the Rockets to proceed in a positive direction, they almost certainly must add someone who lands clearly ahead of Wall in the pecking order. How will Wall react when that happens?"
0,Ighalo who was on loan at United from Shanghai Shenhua penned a heartfelt farewell thanking fans and the manager for their support. His fell in the pecking order following the arrival of Uruguayan forward Edinson Cavani after scoring five goals across 23 appearances in all competitions for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. The transfer window in Saudi Arabia runs until February 7.
0,"He has recorded 95 tackles and just 6 sacks since becoming a pro. When San Francisco turned the corner to become a contender in 2019, and the defensive line became elite, Thomas fell down the pecking order. He played greater than 50% of the defensive snaps just three times in 16 games during the 2019 season."
0,"But when the regulars started to return, Ighalo’s stock unsurprisingly dipped. He saw his playing time diminish as he slid down the pecking order behind Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani. Though his dream run ended, Ighalo made it clear that his heart still belonged with the Red Devils."
0,"My job as a head coach is to make the team as good as they possibly can be, to play to our potential,"" said Farrell. There's a pecking order at this moment in time where two teams are going in as favourites and we aspire to be that. I suppose that comes from hard work and performing under pressure."
0,"Golden paper wasps have demanding social lives. To keep track of who’s who in a complex pecking order, they have to recognize and remember many individual faces. Now, an experiment suggests the brains of these wasps process faces all at once—similar to how human facial recognition works."
0,"If only one is selected, mock drafters seem to default to the other corner. It appears a pecking order has developed among those three players, at least among mock drafters. It also means that mock drafters aren't convinced that another corner that has slipped into the No. 10 spot, South Carolina cornerback Jaycee Horn, is worth the selection."
