Charles’s gullibility and Jean’s determination makes for a nonstop roller coaster of darkly funny hijinks as the two fall in and out of love while simultaneously trying to get back at one another for betraying the other."
1,"The ""people"", that part of society that institutional ‘representation’ is not representing, are here sending a timely reminder to their leaders. In their respective press releases, the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), the Tunisian Forum for Social and Economic Rights (FTDES) and the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers (ATJA) also underline the culpability of successive governments since 2011 in the deterioration of the social situation, the aggravation of corruption and the “hijacking of the revolution to the profit of the lobbies” (ATJA). The UGTT considers that “settling for repressive solutions and propelling the security and military forces into confrontation with the public is an ineffective and unproductive method of solving the problems of hundreds of thousands of marginalised youth”."
1,"the Defendants are likewise accused of peppering a young surgical technologist with unwanted ads pushing pot. Aram seeks to represent: “All persons in the United States who (1) received a text message to their cellular phone number from Defendants, (2) within four years prior to the filing of this action, (3) which text message was sent without the recipient’s prior express consent, and (4) which text message(s) (a) advertised Defendants or (b) encouraged the recipient to make a purchase from Defendants.” Both of these cases were just filed on Friday and continue a trend the cannabis industry must make a note of."

1,"To find out why birds are so much more vulnerable, Riddell spent 2 years measuring heat transfer and light absorption in the fur and feathers of museum specimens of 50 desert bird species and 24 small mammals. He then fed those numbers and data on the species’ behavior and habitat into a computer program that modeled how much heat stress an animal would be exposed to, and how well it could cool itself, under different temperature conditions. To keep cool, birds must expend energy, for example by dilating blood vessels to evaporate moisture from their legs or mouths."

Leinster have become such a big fish in such a small pool that something will have to give. Last week Connacht surprised them and while Connacht were admirable in their objectives, not much was made of the fact that Leinster had just one regular starter who played the entire match."
1,"After a decade at Catfish Bay, Ice Fish Fest is a tournament that, much like the fish, continues to grow. I've got whole families that are making this an event where we've got people coming down from Minnesota to spend some time together and I've got serious anglers bringing in serious electronic gear to try and catch big fish, so it is really cool how this thing all works out and it's fun,"" Bruns said. Gates open at 10:30 tomorrow morning."
1,"And you have to set up your infrastructure differently if you're going to be successful investing into that nation [because] there's just a lot of ground cover. One of the things that we have been able to do is to look at venture capital and say, 'Look, there are a lot of rote, repetitive tasks that venture capitalists do, and what if we could eliminate those tasks, so that we don't need to hire the boiler room of Ivy League grads to cold call the entire phone book and annoy all the entrepreneurs and do all that kind of stuff. We can do more homework in an automated fashion.'"
1,"The upshot is a gap in secure power generation and grid balancing that must be fixed."" Europe hasn't come this close to a major blackout since 2006 when more than 15 million households were plunged into darkness for hours, although there was another narrow escape when the frequency dropped dangerously low at the start of 2019. Europe's grid operators have put in automatic responses like splitting the network and triggering standby generation or demand reduction."
1,"When the Civil War split America, Montgomery Blair, President Lincoln's postmaster general, used the savings from suspending service in the Confederacy to upgrade the Union's mail system. He expanded the Railway Mail Service, authorized the first money orders and began deliveries to urban residences, while the post became the first major institution to employ large numbers of women and African Americans. The innovations that followed included Rural Free Delivery (1896) and Parcel Post (1913), which brought rural residents into the mainstream."
