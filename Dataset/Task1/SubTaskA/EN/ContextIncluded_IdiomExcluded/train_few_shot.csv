1,"And that’s to say nothing of all the couples who don’t feel comfortable getting pregnant or bringing an infant into the world in the current health climate regardless of how much money they have, and whose stance is that a viable coronavirus vaccine is an absolute requirement for starting a family. On the other hand, it’s not like promising people 100,000 yen is going to make them less likely to have kids, and the proposal at least sounds more realistic than trying to pump up the birth rate by having artificial intelligence programs pick out spouses for people or simply relying on parents to nag their adult children into procreating. The proposal is scheduled to be introduced at a meeting of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly in February, and if approved would go into effect this spring."
1,"After years of failed efforts to boost the birth rate, South Korea’s government now says it will focus some of its energy on learning to live with population decline, rather than simply trying to halt it. The government has ""found it will be difficult to reverse the low birth rate trend in the near future” and so will be adopting a ""two track” approach of encouraging births, while finding ways to adjust the economy to a shrinking and aging population, according to a joint statement from 11 ministries on Wednesday. South Korea’s fertility rate of 0.92 was the world’s lowest in 2019, and likely fell further last year as the uncertainty of the pandemic discouraged young people from marrying and having children."
1,"To solve the problems of senior citizens is to help them enjoy the fruits of economic development by improving their living standards, especially as advanced technologies have created opportunities for senior citizens to participate in various social activities. Many misunderstand the relationship among a low birth rate, aging population and negative population growth. The decline in the population is inevitable even if the family planning policy is further relaxed, simply because couples are unwilling to have two children－with some preferring to not have any child－not because of the policy, but because of the problems associated with raising a child."

So Aaron faced the same brutal racism other Black players of the era experienced, especially as the slugger approached Ruth’s home run record. This Black man in the deep South was about to break a record that no one really thought could ever be broken and that was not wearing well on a lot of (white) people,” Kendrick told the MLB Network, shortly after getting word of Aaron's passing."

The fact that Pompeo would even acknowledge comments comparing the U.S. to a “banana republic” — a term most often used to derisively describe military dictatorships in Latin America and Africa — was a sign that the events of Wednesday have caused significant damage to U.S. standing as a champion of democracy and human rights. His comments reflected an understanding of the international concern about the violent attack on Congress by supporters of the outgoing president and represent an attempt to shut down ridicule of the U.S. from countries that have often been on the receiving end of U.S. criticism for democratic backsliding."

The history of the banana republic reminds us that the notion of the United States as a beacon of human rights and democracy is, for all too many across the globe, a lie. The uncomfortable truth is that this history — like the long record of American racism, overt and structural, and the endless involvement in war — demonstrates that violence is as American as apple pie."

Since the past decade, southern and western provinces of the country are frequently hit by severe sand and dust storms, as well as drought, which is caused by both internal and external hotpots. Major external SDSs sources are Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq."
1,"For example, during spring and summer in the planet's southern hemisphere, Mars is closer to the sun and moving faster. The closer proximity to the sun warms the planet's atmosphere, and the increased warmth and the planet's increased speeds whipping around so close to the sun stir up particles in the Martian soil, which can lead to intense dust storms that can stretch around the entire globe. In fact, in 2019, NASA's Opportunity rover ""died"" after a global dust storm covered the craft's solar arrays, preventing its batteries from charging and causing it to lose contact with mission teams on Earth."
1,"Although we do not have observations of iron concentrations in the water, results from other studies in the Tasman suggest that less iron can limit phytoplankton growth south of the Tasman Front, which is indeed where we saw the greatest phytoplankton response. As a result of global warming, droughts will likely become more frequent and the number of severe dust storms in Australia may increase in the future. There is some evidence that the amount of dust in the atmosphere over the continent is already changing due to enhanced dust storm activity."

When you have that much debris in the air, not only is it stuff like sand and other particulates, but there's also bacteria and viruses,"" Tarbox said."

A generation of farmers was left moving around the country desperately searching for work."

There are three key factors responsible for the generation of sand and dust storms – strong wind, lack of vegetation, and absence of rainfall. The environmental and health hazards of such storms cannot be reduced permanently, however, its impact can be reduced by taking appropriate measures."
1,"This process in fact happens naturally when dust blows from the land to the ocean, particularly from deserts such as the Sahara and Patagonia. But although dust storms are frequent during the Australian spring and summer, and Australian dust has a high iron content, witnessing the oceans bloom has proven elusive. Now, however, armed with satellite data, we've recorded phytoplankton blooming, almost certainly due to Australian dust storms."

URBANA — As Principal Joe Wiemelt and his staff mapped out what classes would look like when students return to Urbana Middle School on Tuesday, they began putting together a spreadsheet, detailing the various aspects they’d need to think about in different tabs. Those tabs began to pile up as they planned out how they’d handle arrival and dismissal, transitioning students from one area to another, how a teacher might reserve a bigger room, and more."

Five hundred years hence we shall be quite ancient history ourselves, and folks can romance over our tombstones if they feel inclined.  And after all, why should one's ancestors do everything for one? I guess I'd rather make my mark in the world for myself,'—for the boy had all the enthusiasm of a pioneer about him, added to a sturdy spirit of independence."
1,"Brazilian specificity lies in our experience with social and cultural situations that can be very valuable when it comes to understanding Antiquity (and criticizing the present one), such as social inequality, social exclusion, patrimonialism and patriarchalism, a peripheral situation, and others,"" explains Pedro Paulo Funari, a professor of ancient history and classical archeology at Unicamp. Studying ancient history in Brazil today has two important aspects: knowing the history of the country itself and seeing how the uses of the ancient past are linked to different forms of discourse and everyday practices, and also through specialization in universities, learning to look for more dynamic interpretations that indicate the social, gender or ethnic diversity on which these societies were built. As we live in a country with a very acute social and cultural diversity, I think that one of the contributions of this type of study is the possibility of producing more plural, interpretive models about the ancient world,"" guarantees Renata Senna Garraffoni, a professor of ancient history at the Department of History at the Federal University of Parana, who recently won a scholarship from the British Academy in England to study Roman gladiatorial games."

1,"To find out why birds are so much more vulnerable, Riddell spent 2 years measuring heat transfer and light absorption in the fur and feathers of museum specimens of 50 desert bird species and 24 small mammals. He then fed those numbers and data on the species’ behavior and habitat into a computer program that modeled how much heat stress an animal would be exposed to, and how well it could cool itself, under different temperature conditions. To keep cool, birds must expend energy, for example by dilating blood vessels to evaporate moisture from their legs or mouths."
