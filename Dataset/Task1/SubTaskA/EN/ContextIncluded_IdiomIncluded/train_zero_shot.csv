0,"While the Nuggets offered Grant a comparable contract to stay, the forward’s role on the team would have looked a little different. With Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray ahead of him in the pecking order of scoring options, he likely would have been deployed for his defensive skills as opposed to his ability to create opportunities on offense. Grant has taken just over half the average number of shots he took in Denver, putting up roughly 17.9 field goal attempts per game versus the 8.9 he tried the season before.",pecking order

0,"He’s quick, and seems to have a great playmaking sense about him. Espinoza might just be the most likely of the three to become a regular starter, if he can prove to Raphael Wicky he’s ready to jump ahead of veteran Boris Sekulic in the right back pecking order. Offor, the Nigerian forward who spent time in the Latvian league, appears a bit raw, but seems to have an intelligent nose for goal, and should figure to be an exciting replacement for CJ Sapong.",pecking order

Scott needs minutes to show she can still perform consistently at the top level, having slipped down the pecking order at Manchester City with the arrival of the US World Cup winner Sam Mewis.

Our Nancy is an uncomplicated character, she is not at the bottom of the pecking order so I'm not sure why she has been at the receiving end.
