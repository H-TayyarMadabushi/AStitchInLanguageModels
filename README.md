# AStitchInLanguageModels: Dataset and Methods for the Exploration of Idiomaticity in Pre-Trained Language Models

This package contains the dataset AStitchInLanguageModels and associated task information. 

This dataset and associated tasks were introduced in our EMNLP 2021 paper "AStitchInLanguageModels: Dataset and Methods for the Exploration of Idiomaticity in Pre-Trained Language Models"

This is a novel dataset consisting of: 
* Naturally occurring sentences (and two surrounding sentences) containing potentially idiomatic MWEs annotated with a fine-grained set of meanings: compositional meaning, idiomatic meaning(s), proper noun and "meta usage". See Tasks ([Task 1](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/blob/main/README.md#task-1-idiomaticity-detection), [Task 2](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/blob/main/README.md#task-2-idiomaticity-representation)) for details and Raw Data Section for complete data.
* Data in both Portuguese and English
* Paraphrases for each meaning of each MWE; (See [Extended Noun Compound Senses Dataset](#Extended-Noun-Compound-Senses-Dataset))

In addition, we use this dataset to define two tasks:
* These tasks are aimed at evaluating i) a modelâ€™s ability to detect idiomatic use ([Task 1](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/blob/main/README.md#task-1-idiomaticity-detection)), and ii) the effectiveness of sentence embeddings in representing idiomaticity ([Task 2](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/blob/main/README.md#task-2-idiomaticity-representation)).
* These tasks are presented in multilingual, zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot settings.
* We provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art models, including experiments with one-shot and few-shot setups for idiomaticity detection and the use of the ***idiom principle*** for detecting and representing MWEs in contextual embeddings. Our results highlight the significant scope for improvement.

## Task 1: Idiomaticity Detection

The first task we propose is designed to evaluate the extent to which models can identify idiomaticity in text and consists of two Subtasks: a _coarse-grained_ classification task (Subtask A) and a _fine-grained_ classification task (Subtask B). The evaluation metric for this task is F1. 

The data associated with this Task can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/tree/main/Dataset/Task1). Data is split into zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot data in both Portuguese and English. Please see the paper for a detailed description of the task and methods. 

We used ðŸ¤— Transformers ([this script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/62ba3b6b43975e759851336b566852252be00669/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py)) for training with the following hyperparameters. Further details are available in the paper.

## Task 2: Idiomaticity Representation


## Extended Noun Compound Senses Dataset

We also provide an [Extended Noun Compound Senses dataset](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/tree/main/Dataset/Extended_Noun_Compound_Senses_Dataset) that is highly granular. This data differs from previous sense datasets in that: 
 * it provides all possible senses,
 * we ensure that meanings provided are as close to the original phrase as possible to ensure that this dataset is an adversarial dataset, 
 * we highlight purely compositional noun compounds. 

Please see the [associated data folder](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/tree/main/Dataset/Extended_Noun_Compound_Senses_Dataset) for more details. 

## Raw Data

You can download the raw annotation data from [this folder](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/tree/main/Dataset/TaskIndependentData). 

We strongly recommend that you use the Task datasets described above if you are working on related tasks. We also recommend that you use the associated data splits to keep results comparable. 

If you working on an unrelated task, you can adapt the raw data provided. The data format is described in the [data folder](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/AStitchInLanguageModels/tree/main/Dataset/TaskIndependentData).
